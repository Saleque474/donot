1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,930
Now I'd like to show you the love that I'm going to be using during this course.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,860
So basically I have my calendar.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:20,290
As I said it's installed or not hunter is installed on a Nexus 7 device.

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,340
I have the device here mirrored on my laptop.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,170
I'm doing this because it's easier to show you what I'm doing on a device like this and sort of using

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,150
a camera because I'd lose quality.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,620
So this is actually this is not a virtual machine.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,060
This is a physical Android device that I'm using and this is just programs that I'm using to measure

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,750
the screen of the device.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:53,950
And here I have my windows device who will going to try to how kids may be hacked passwords or usernames

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,420
or stuff from this account.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,750
So this is a virtual machine thumb it makes an actual real machine.

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:04,280
This is an actual physical Nexus 7 device that has nets Hunter installed on it.

14
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,280
And this is my main operating system.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,690
So let's just have a quick look on that Hunter home.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:23,450
So this is it's icon right here so I'm going to click it now and as you can see you just get the basic

17
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,750
welcome screen where you see your wireless cards and you can request your external life.

18
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,760
You can click on that.

19
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:38,180
I'll get my external IP if we go here on the top left.

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,190
You'll see all the menus that you can go.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,500
Basically this whole menu allow you to access all features for that hunter.

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,780
So within this menu you can navigate and run multiple attacks.

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,830
So if we just go to the first one the Culdee luncher you'll see a number of options that you have here.

24
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,950
So the first one launch can the shell and terminal basically will give you a terminal window where you

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,280
can use all the programs that come installed with that Hunter so tough that

26
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,290
it's going to it's going to ask me to granted access the root access and I'm going to say there's no

27
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,250
problem.

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:32,640
And as you can see now I have my access and I can run any programs that I want to run from within this

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,120
menu.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,050
Now we will be using this and you're right now I'm not going to run anything because that's not our

31
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,580
lesson.

32
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,130
We're just going to have a quick look on everything that we can do.

33
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,900
We will be using this later.

34
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,660
So I'm just going to close it to go back decal them in here.

35
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:57,030
The second option gives you a terminal menu that allow you to run a number of programs.

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,710
So as you can see right here we have a number beside each program that we want to run and you can just

37
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,730
put the number that you want and it's going to take you to different menus and it's going to allow you

38
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,260
to run different accounts.

39
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,900
Again I'm not going to be using this right now because this allows you to run a number of programs and

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,770
we will be using it in the future.

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,560
I'm just showing you how this works.

42
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,080
So I'm going to close it again.

43
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,880
The third one.

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,460
Launch boy fights Why fight is a wife.

45
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,380
Penetration testing.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,210
And the second option is going to update Carly second US is going to turn off if we have an external

47
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,590
wiper.

48
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,760
It's going to turn it off.

49
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,000
And the last one will unwiped.

50
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,470
So the first one actually lunch Kelly and terminal.

51
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,760
The last one will unmount.

52
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,120
Kelly

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,320
the service control this allows you to turn services on and off.

54
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,710
So these are servers that come in preinstalled on net hunter and you can turn them on and off using

55
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,680
these options.

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:12,120
So you have the framework S-sh DNS dnsmasq and all these kind of servers topit to turn it on.

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,390
So S-sh is not what's up.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,380
And if you turn it on top it again it goes off again.

59
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,480
I will be talking about what each one of these mean.

60
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:28,070
And when we will need to use them right now we're just having a quick look.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,490
After that we have the A-H I.D. keyboard talk and I'm not gonna talk about it right now.

62
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,900
We'll going to have a full class about or maybe actually more than one class about this.

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,620
Same with th id Durkee attacks and WSP man in the middle attacks man.

64
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,660
Evil likes point.

65
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,380
All of these were actually going to spend more than one lunch lecture talking about them.

66
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:56,090
So I'm going to ask Kip all of these here and the last to allow you to configure IP tables and yet DNS

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,730
mosque.

68
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,730
Again I will be talking about each one of these later so don't be scared of other names or the number

69
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,430
of features that you can see here.

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,260
Right now we're just having a quick look on the launcher menu.

71
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:16,500
So the main the main parts of this class is you can Roncalli you can run features from all features

72
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,480
from within this window.

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,660
You can Roncalli in terminal you can run the menu in terminal as well which allow you to run a number

74
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,470
of programs.

75
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,700
We're going to be using all of this for multiple times within the course so it's going to become very

76
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,560
easy and it's going to expand itself even more as we progress through the course.
