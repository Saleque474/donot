00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,920
Welcome to the first section of our course and this section we're going to be talking about weaponized

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,890
in your Android device.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:14,470
So we're going to talk about how what the programs that you're going to need to install on your Android

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:21,780
device so that you can use it as a penetration testing to the main program or the main software that

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:29,840
we need to install is called Net hunter and that Hunter is an Android operating system or a flavor of

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:38,100
Android does come in with a number of programs pre-installed that are used for penetration testing that

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,750
Hunter is free so you can download it for free and install it and it's supported on all access devices.

8
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,180
So that's Nexus 4 5 6 and 7 at the moment.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,740
And the one plus there are other versions for other Android devices but there are not officially supported.

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:03,330
So the only devices that are supported officially are the nexus and the one plus installing that Hunter

11
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,150
is very simple we have to do a few things first before we can install it first we're going to have to

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,710
install the drivers on our computers so that the computer can recognize our Android device.

13
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,890
Then we're going to unlock the device.

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,150
And we're going to route it route is basically an account that has the highest privileges and Linux

15
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,900
systems.

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:32,620
So androids actually built on Linux and because of that we need to install a root account on it.

17
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,590
The router can't because it has the highest privileges it allow us to do or to gain full control over

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,010
the device so we will have full control over the hardware and we will be able to run specific tasks

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,640
that we cannot run without the router account.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,500
Then we're going to install net hunter which is the modified Android draw ramp that contains all the

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,510
programs that we need for penetration testing.

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,560
This whole process is very simple.

23
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,510
It's not as complicated as it seems.

24
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,920
And we're going to see how we can do it in the next lectures.
