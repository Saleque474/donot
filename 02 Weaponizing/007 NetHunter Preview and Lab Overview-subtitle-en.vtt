00:04.320 --> 00:08.930
Now I'd like to show you the love that I'm going to be using during this course.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.860
So basically I have my calendar.

00:13.900 --> 00:20.290
As I said it's installed or not hunter is installed on a Nexus 7 device.

00:20.290 --> 00:23.340
I have the device here mirrored on my laptop.

00:24.480 --> 00:30.170
I'm doing this because it's easier to show you what I'm doing on a device like this and sort of using

00:30.170 --> 00:32.150
a camera because I'd lose quality.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.620
So this is actually this is not a virtual machine.

00:34.620 --> 00:42.060
This is a physical Android device that I'm using and this is just programs that I'm using to measure

00:42.540 --> 00:44.750
the screen of the device.

00:46.420 --> 00:53.950
And here I have my windows device who will going to try to how kids may be hacked passwords or usernames

00:53.950 --> 00:55.420
or stuff from this account.

00:55.420 --> 00:58.750
So this is a virtual machine thumb it makes an actual real machine.

00:58.990 --> 01:04.280
This is an actual physical Nexus 7 device that has nets Hunter installed on it.

01:04.930 --> 01:09.280
And this is my main operating system.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.690
So let's just have a quick look on that Hunter home.

01:15.700 --> 01:23.450
So this is it's icon right here so I'm going to click it now and as you can see you just get the basic

01:23.870 --> 01:29.750
welcome screen where you see your wireless cards and you can request your external life.

01:29.750 --> 01:30.760
You can click on that.

01:30.770 --> 01:38.180
I'll get my external IP if we go here on the top left.

01:38.310 --> 01:41.190
You'll see all the menus that you can go.

01:41.190 --> 01:46.500
Basically this whole menu allow you to access all features for that hunter.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.780
So within this menu you can navigate and run multiple attacks.

01:51.780 --> 01:58.830
So if we just go to the first one the Culdee luncher you'll see a number of options that you have here.

01:59.070 --> 02:04.950
So the first one launch can the shell and terminal basically will give you a terminal window where you

02:04.950 --> 02:12.280
can use all the programs that come installed with that Hunter so tough that

02:17.140 --> 02:23.290
it's going to it's going to ask me to granted access the root access and I'm going to say there's no

02:23.290 --> 02:24.250
problem.

02:25.540 --> 02:32.640
And as you can see now I have my access and I can run any programs that I want to run from within this

02:32.640 --> 02:33.120
menu.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.050
Now we will be using this and you're right now I'm not going to run anything because that's not our

02:37.050 --> 02:37.580
lesson.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.130
We're just going to have a quick look on everything that we can do.

02:40.170 --> 02:42.900
We will be using this later.

02:42.950 --> 02:49.660
So I'm just going to close it to go back decal them in here.

02:49.660 --> 02:57.030
The second option gives you a terminal menu that allow you to run a number of programs.

02:57.190 --> 03:02.710
So as you can see right here we have a number beside each program that we want to run and you can just

03:02.710 --> 03:06.730
put the number that you want and it's going to take you to different menus and it's going to allow you

03:06.730 --> 03:09.260
to run different accounts.

03:09.270 --> 03:13.900
Again I'm not going to be using this right now because this allows you to run a number of programs and

03:13.900 --> 03:15.770
we will be using it in the future.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.560
I'm just showing you how this works.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.080
So I'm going to close it again.

03:22.930 --> 03:23.880
The third one.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.460
Launch boy fights Why fight is a wife.

03:26.460 --> 03:28.380
Penetration testing.

03:28.750 --> 03:35.210
And the second option is going to update Carly second US is going to turn off if we have an external

03:35.210 --> 03:35.590
wiper.

03:35.630 --> 03:36.760
It's going to turn it off.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.000
And the last one will unwiped.

03:39.030 --> 03:42.470
So the first one actually lunch Kelly and terminal.

03:42.470 --> 03:43.760
The last one will unmount.

03:43.770 --> 03:44.120
Kelly

03:47.460 --> 03:53.320
the service control this allows you to turn services on and off.

03:53.330 --> 04:00.710
So these are servers that come in preinstalled on net hunter and you can turn them on and off using

04:00.710 --> 04:01.680
these options.

04:03.360 --> 04:12.120
So you have the framework S-sh DNS dnsmasq and all these kind of servers topit to turn it on.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.390
So S-sh is not what's up.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.380
And if you turn it on top it again it goes off again.

04:18.570 --> 04:21.480
I will be talking about what each one of these mean.

04:21.630 --> 04:28.070
And when we will need to use them right now we're just having a quick look.

04:28.170 --> 04:32.490
After that we have the A-H I.D. keyboard talk and I'm not gonna talk about it right now.

04:32.490 --> 04:36.900
We'll going to have a full class about or maybe actually more than one class about this.

04:36.900 --> 04:43.620
Same with th id Durkee attacks and WSP man in the middle attacks man.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.660
Evil likes point.

04:44.670 --> 04:48.380
All of these were actually going to spend more than one lunch lecture talking about them.

04:48.450 --> 04:56.090
So I'm going to ask Kip all of these here and the last to allow you to configure IP tables and yet DNS

04:56.100 --> 04:56.730
mosque.

04:56.850 --> 05:02.730
Again I will be talking about each one of these later so don't be scared of other names or the number

05:02.730 --> 05:04.430
of features that you can see here.

05:04.440 --> 05:09.260
Right now we're just having a quick look on the launcher menu.

05:09.330 --> 05:16.500
So the main the main parts of this class is you can Roncalli you can run features from all features

05:16.500 --> 05:18.480
from within this window.

05:18.480 --> 05:24.660
You can Roncalli in terminal you can run the menu in terminal as well which allow you to run a number

05:24.660 --> 05:25.470
of programs.

05:25.530 --> 05:29.700
We're going to be using all of this for multiple times within the course so it's going to become very

05:29.700 --> 05:34.560
easy and it's going to expand itself even more as we progress through the course.
