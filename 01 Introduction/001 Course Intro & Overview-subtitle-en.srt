00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,090
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,230
My name is zayd.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,350
I'm an ethical hacker a computer scientist and I'll be your instructor in this course and this goes

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,280
should go and learn how to use your Android device and penetration tester so you'll be able to use a

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,390
phone or a tablet in order to hack into computers phones tablets or any computer system really even

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,430
networks the really cool thing about using your Android device is first of all it's more portable than

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,280
a laptop.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,670
Can if you're walking into a company or an organization you're going to look much less suspicious using

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,420
your Android device than using a laptop.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,520
Also there is a large number of social engineering attacks that you can do and you can perform by simply

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,070
connecting your Android device to the computer or to the network that you're trying to hack.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,130
So I'm going to start with you from scratch.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,190
So the first thing you're going to learn is you're going to learn how to prepare your Android device

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,290
for penetration testing.

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,470
I'm going to show you what programs that you need to install and how to set up the whole operating system

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,140
to use it and penetration testing was done with that.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,810
We're going to move into our first section which is information gathering in which you're going to learn

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,370
how to gather information about Web sites computers networks or anything that exists around you.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,860
Once done with that we're going to move into our two most fun sections which is the spying and the exploitation

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,560
sections and the spike section.

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,750
You're going to learn how to spy on computers and networks.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,440
So we're going to learn how to become the man in the middle using a number of methods and what this

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,640
basically means is that you will be able to capture anything sent or received from your target computer.

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,730
This means you'll be able to capture usernames passwords or anything your target computer does.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,940
We're going to be able to achieve this wirelessly or by connecting your Android device to the target's

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,610
computer using the U.S. cable once done with that.

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,330
We're going to move on to the exploitation section.

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,120
Where are you going to learn how to gain full control over computer systems.

29
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,440
So again you'll be able to gain control over any computer that's in your network.

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,440
You'll also be able to gain control over computers by simply connecting your Android device using the

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,060
US cable.

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,640
You'll also see how you can bypass logon screens.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,830
So if your target computer uses Marcos or Windows and it's locked so you need to enter a password to

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,960
use a computer.

35
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,160
We'll see how you can bypass that by simply connecting your Android device to that to that computer

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,340
at the end of the cursor will also cover some security features that you can do or precautions that

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,730
you can do in order to protect yourself from these kind of attacks.

38
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,640
Now all the attacks explained in this course are real attacks performed against real computers in my

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,000
lab.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,310
So they're not proof of concepts or attacks that actually work.

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,440
The course is highly practical.

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,680
But before we do any attack we'll actually learn how it works theoretically and then we're going to

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,650
move in to the practical side.
