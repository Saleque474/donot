Hello and welcome.

00:02.330 --> 00:03.230
My name is zayd.

00:03.260 --> 00:08.350
I'm an ethical hacker a computer scientist and I'll be your instructor in this course and this goes

00:08.350 --> 00:13.280
should go and learn how to use your Android device and penetration tester so you'll be able to use a

00:13.280 --> 00:20.390
phone or a tablet in order to hack into computers phones tablets or any computer system really even

00:20.390 --> 00:26.430
networks the really cool thing about using your Android device is first of all it's more portable than

00:26.430 --> 00:27.280
a laptop.

00:27.320 --> 00:32.670
Can if you're walking into a company or an organization you're going to look much less suspicious using

00:32.670 --> 00:35.420
your Android device than using a laptop.

00:35.430 --> 00:41.520
Also there is a large number of social engineering attacks that you can do and you can perform by simply

00:41.670 --> 00:47.070
connecting your Android device to the computer or to the network that you're trying to hack.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.130
So I'm going to start with you from scratch.

00:49.140 --> 00:53.190
So the first thing you're going to learn is you're going to learn how to prepare your Android device

00:53.190 --> 00:54.290
for penetration testing.

00:54.290 --> 00:58.470
I'm going to show you what programs that you need to install and how to set up the whole operating system

00:58.740 --> 01:02.140
to use it and penetration testing was done with that.

01:02.130 --> 01:06.810
We're going to move into our first section which is information gathering in which you're going to learn

01:06.810 --> 01:12.370
how to gather information about Web sites computers networks or anything that exists around you.

01:13.800 --> 01:19.860
Once done with that we're going to move into our two most fun sections which is the spying and the exploitation

01:19.860 --> 01:22.560
sections and the spike section.

01:22.570 --> 01:26.750
You're going to learn how to spy on computers and networks.

01:26.750 --> 01:31.440
So we're going to learn how to become the man in the middle using a number of methods and what this

01:31.440 --> 01:37.640
basically means is that you will be able to capture anything sent or received from your target computer.

01:37.650 --> 01:42.730
This means you'll be able to capture usernames passwords or anything your target computer does.

01:42.740 --> 01:47.940
We're going to be able to achieve this wirelessly or by connecting your Android device to the target's

01:47.940 --> 01:52.610
computer using the U.S. cable once done with that.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.330
We're going to move on to the exploitation section.

01:55.460 --> 01:59.120
Where are you going to learn how to gain full control over computer systems.

01:59.330 --> 02:03.440
So again you'll be able to gain control over any computer that's in your network.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.440
You'll also be able to gain control over computers by simply connecting your Android device using the

02:09.440 --> 02:11.060
US cable.

02:11.060 --> 02:13.640
You'll also see how you can bypass logon screens.

02:13.640 --> 02:18.830
So if your target computer uses Marcos or Windows and it's locked so you need to enter a password to

02:18.830 --> 02:19.960
use a computer.

02:19.970 --> 02:25.160
We'll see how you can bypass that by simply connecting your Android device to that to that computer

02:26.150 --> 02:31.340
at the end of the cursor will also cover some security features that you can do or precautions that

02:31.340 --> 02:34.730
you can do in order to protect yourself from these kind of attacks.

02:36.430 --> 02:42.640
Now all the attacks explained in this course are real attacks performed against real computers in my

02:42.640 --> 02:43.000
lab.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.310
So they're not proof of concepts or attacks that actually work.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.440
The course is highly practical.

02:48.550 --> 02:53.680
But before we do any attack we'll actually learn how it works theoretically and then we're going to

02:53.680 --> 02:55.650
move in to the practical side.
