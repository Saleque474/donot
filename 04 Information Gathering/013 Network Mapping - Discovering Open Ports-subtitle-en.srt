1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,870
So in the previous video we saw how we can map or discover all the connected devices to our network.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,660
We were only able to get very basic information such as their IP address their MAC address and then

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,860
the manufacturer of the MAC address.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,580
Now today we're going to use a tool called Zanti 2 which is a mobile penetration testing framework.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,130
It allows us to run a number of attacks and information gathering tasks.

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,450
So we're going to be using this tool in different videos.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,520
And today's video we're going to use it to discover all the connected devices and get more information

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,410
than the last time.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,340
So we're going to see what kind of information we'll get.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,490
We'll be able to guess.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,450
We will get the MAC address an IP just like last time but we will also be able to get the operating

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,380
system the open court and preview in future videos we'll even try to get the programs that are running

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,530
on this ports and the version of these programs.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,320
So Zanti is not available on the App Store so you can download this from the following link.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,940
All you have to do is just download it top it and install it.

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,620
So make sure you download this link from your mobile device or from your tablet.

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,640
Now once you download Zanti it's going to look like this.

18
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,030
So I'm just going to tap on it and I've already run this.

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,270
So as you can see discover devices so I'm just going to tap on the refresh sign there.

20
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,840
And I'm not going to use the intrusive scan which looks for vulnerabilities.

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,710
I'm just going to leave it the way it is and I'm going to type OK.

22
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,560
And as you can see it's saying that it's mapping the network is trying to discover the connected devices.

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,170
OK.

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,070
So now as you can see it stopped mapping the devices and we have all the devices that are connected

25
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,070
to the network.

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,310
And as you can see the first thing you notice beside each device on this column you see an icon that

27
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,990
represents the operating system or the type of device.

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,330
So you can see for the first hour right here you have a router icon which tells you that this is a router

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,530
that also was able to get the MAC address and the manufacturer telling us it's a HTC device or the wireless

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:33,140
card or the wireless hardware used in that router is made by HTC if we go on the next one you can see

31
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,930
as well the IP the MAC address and that it is an Android device which is actually this device as you

32
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,300
can see it says on the bottom of this device.

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,430
And then the next one it was able to detect that it's a Linux device.

34
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,390
I remember last time it wasn't one we used Wi-Fi analyzer.

35
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,580
It wasn't able to tell us what operating system used devices.

36
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,490
So from here we can actually know that this is a Linux device or something that runs Linux.

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,670
We still have the name of the device which is as 00 us and we have the MAC address and the manufacturer.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,270
And the next one we can see that we discovered an Apple device and the name of the device is that 00

39
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:11,870
said.

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,280
And it says an Apple device here as well.

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,880
And we have the MAC address.

42
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,730
Another extra thing that you notice is right here which is the ports that are open on each device.

43
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,270
So we can see that if we tap on the router you'll see that it has one port open.

44
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:34,390
So if we go on the absconds right here on the top right you can see that it has port.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,060
If you open

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,330
now and map is actually a command line tool that it's short for network marker and it's the best and

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,680
most popular port scanner that is there on the Internet now you can use this on Linux on Windows and

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
on all operating systems.

49
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,330
It actually comes in installed with Nat hunters so you can run if you know how to use and you can actually

50
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,400
run the commands using the command line in that Hunter and you'll be able to get the results or you

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,400
can use Zanti and I'll show you in the next video is how you can actually use and map from within Zanti.

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,180
And this is all the information that was able to get but you don't really need to go through this as

53
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,440
it's already shown in the back in the main menu here.

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,070
So basically what Zanti does Iran's and my for you.

55
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,480
And then it shows you the results in a really nice and organized way.

56
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,560
So what if you needed to go through the command line you have it by clicking on the maps counts as I

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,830
showed you another device so I'm going to show you.

58
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,880
Here is the next device I'm going to tap on it.

59
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,160
The open ports as you can see there here port 80 9 0 2 4 9 1 5.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,540
Now we don't know what's running on this port site even if we come here on the unmap scans and I'm just

61
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,180
going to look for that next device.

62
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,720
So it's one 45 it's IP which is this one.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,770
So if you come here we can actually just see the open port.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,430
As you can see right here we have eighty nine 0 2 and 4 9 1 5 2.

65
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,050
We don't know what what programs are on and on them like we can't see that 1862.

66
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,240
It's usually hasty.

67
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,150
So it's not a big deal like it didn't really tell us more information about it.

68
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,240
So we'd like to know for example what server is not our port what version of that server so we can actually

69
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,310
try and hack that computer through that server or through that port.

70
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,270
Sorry.

71
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,220
So I'll go back and I want to show you something like I mentioned that information gathering is one

72
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,860
of the most important steps in penetration testing.

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,170
And I wasn't overexaggerating it because let me show you this so I'm going to go on this suppled device

74
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,220
and this is my own tablet.

75
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,750
It's still broken.

76
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:59,000
And as you can see we have to force open port number two to number 2 2 and 4 6 2 0 7 8.

77
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,150
Now 1:56 usually corresponds to S-sh.

78
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,190
So I'm going to go down here just to confirm and show you so 59.

79
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,300
And here you are that's the IP of the Apple device.

80
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,670
And as you can see that we have 4:22 22 open and it has hate support.

81
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,360
So it's for us as a S-sh service.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,170
As I say it basically is a server that allows you to remotely run Linux commands on the target device.

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,510
So it's usually installed on servers for example if you have a web server online when you buy a web

84
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,500
server or rent a web server they'll give you an S-sh account.

85
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:45,550
So S-sh by using it a certain username and password it will allow you to remotely log in to your Linux

86
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,450
or Windows or even Marko's machine and run commands on the target machine.

87
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,540
So when you jailbreak your device with Apple you use a name with when you jailbreak it.

88
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,030
The root password is actually set to a l p i n e.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,170
So it's the default password.

90
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,060
Most people don't know that and even the people that know that they don't change it including me.

91
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,270
I actually never change it like I don't have this just to show you now.

92
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,650
So when I just broke my device the password is still as a p i n.

93
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,140
So for example when you're doing a scan and then you see an Apple device with port 22 open it's a good

94
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,380
idea just to try to log in to that port with the password.

95
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,930
A L P I N E.

96
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,520
Now let me just do this quickly and show you how you can do this from your laptop or from your that

97
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,670
Hunter device.

98
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,770
I'm just going to do it from the net Hunter device.

99
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:46,360
Just because we're doing penetration testing using your mobile phone or using your Android but you can

100
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,600
do it from any device that you want.

101
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:58,740
So I'm just going to go on the net and turn I'm going to go on home so I'm going to go on the luncher

102
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,560
and I'm going to launch Kelly shell and terminal and all I have to do is S-sh into the target.

103
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:16,320
So the come on this S-sh username is rude and you put it and then put the IP address of the target.

104
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:25,350
So the IP address was 1 9 2 6 8 1 2009.

105
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm going to hit enter and it's telling me you want to trust target I'm going to say yes and now it's

106
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,390
asking me for the password so I'm going to use the password.

107
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,630
It's a L P and it's going to hit enter.

108
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,960
And as you can see I logged in as root.

109
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:54,170
So if I go you as you can see that I am rude and if I go if I can think just to show you that I am actually

110
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,100
inside that device doesn't have it configured still I don't have that command installed on my tablet

111
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:08,130
but it is as you can see that it's rude and it's arduous which is the name of the iPod.

112
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:17,240
And if I say my eyes you can't say it's telling me that I am rude and I am at the target device.

113
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,210
Basically you're just going to be using Unix commands to navigate through the system and you can do

114
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,820
whatever you want because you are rude.

115
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,920
And as I said it has all probably all privileges on the target machine.

116
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,470
So this is basically like it wasn't an actual hack.

117
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,690
It was just a use of information that we gather so we saw there an Apple device.

118
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,570
Has S-sh open on it.

119
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,340
So it was definitely broken.

120
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,070
And we just tried the default password and we were able to log in and gain basic full access to this

121
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,720
device.

122
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,980
So even if this device had no exploit it had the latest and greatest software and the best security

123
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,560
measurements we only logged in through a service which is allowed on the device used in proper username

124
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,110
and password.
