WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:07.870
So in the previous video we saw how we can map or discover all the connected devices to our network.

00:07.890 --> 00:13.660
We were only able to get very basic information such as their IP address their MAC address and then

00:13.770 --> 00:16.860
the manufacturer of the MAC address.

00:16.860 --> 00:22.580
Now today we're going to use a tool called Zanti 2 which is a mobile penetration testing framework.

00:22.590 --> 00:29.130
It allows us to run a number of attacks and information gathering tasks.

00:29.190 --> 00:32.450
So we're going to be using this tool in different videos.

00:32.490 --> 00:38.520
And today's video we're going to use it to discover all the connected devices and get more information

00:38.640 --> 00:39.410
than the last time.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.340
So we're going to see what kind of information we'll get.

00:41.340 --> 00:42.490
We'll be able to guess.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.450
We will get the MAC address an IP just like last time but we will also be able to get the operating

00:48.450 --> 00:55.380
system the open court and preview in future videos we'll even try to get the programs that are running

00:55.380 --> 00:58.530
on this ports and the version of these programs.

01:00.680 --> 01:06.320
So Zanti is not available on the App Store so you can download this from the following link.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.940
All you have to do is just download it top it and install it.

01:09.950 --> 01:14.620
So make sure you download this link from your mobile device or from your tablet.

01:16.850 --> 01:20.640
Now once you download Zanti it's going to look like this.

01:22.900 --> 01:28.030
So I'm just going to tap on it and I've already run this.

01:28.040 --> 01:33.270
So as you can see discover devices so I'm just going to tap on the refresh sign there.

01:34.210 --> 01:39.840
And I'm not going to use the intrusive scan which looks for vulnerabilities.

01:39.910 --> 01:43.710
I'm just going to leave it the way it is and I'm going to type OK.

01:46.170 --> 01:51.560
And as you can see it's saying that it's mapping the network is trying to discover the connected devices.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.170
OK.

01:53.190 --> 01:59.070
So now as you can see it stopped mapping the devices and we have all the devices that are connected

01:59.070 --> 02:00.070
to the network.

02:00.420 --> 02:08.310
And as you can see the first thing you notice beside each device on this column you see an icon that

02:08.310 --> 02:11.990
represents the operating system or the type of device.

02:12.030 --> 02:18.330
So you can see for the first hour right here you have a router icon which tells you that this is a router

02:18.640 --> 02:25.530
that also was able to get the MAC address and the manufacturer telling us it's a HTC device or the wireless

02:25.620 --> 02:33.140
card or the wireless hardware used in that router is made by HTC if we go on the next one you can see

02:33.230 --> 02:38.930
as well the IP the MAC address and that it is an Android device which is actually this device as you

02:38.930 --> 02:41.300
can see it says on the bottom of this device.

02:41.630 --> 02:45.430
And then the next one it was able to detect that it's a Linux device.

02:45.450 --> 02:49.390
I remember last time it wasn't one we used Wi-Fi analyzer.

02:49.550 --> 02:52.580
It wasn't able to tell us what operating system used devices.

02:52.820 --> 02:58.490
So from here we can actually know that this is a Linux device or something that runs Linux.

02:58.760 --> 03:04.670
We still have the name of the device which is as 00 us and we have the MAC address and the manufacturer.

03:04.880 --> 03:11.270
And the next one we can see that we discovered an Apple device and the name of the device is that 00

03:11.290 --> 03:11.870
said.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.280
And it says an Apple device here as well.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.880
And we have the MAC address.

03:16.170 --> 03:22.730
Another extra thing that you notice is right here which is the ports that are open on each device.

03:22.730 --> 03:28.270
So we can see that if we tap on the router you'll see that it has one port open.

03:28.490 --> 03:34.390
So if we go on the absconds right here on the top right you can see that it has port.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.060
If you open

03:38.360 --> 03:45.330
now and map is actually a command line tool that it's short for network marker and it's the best and

03:45.350 --> 03:51.680
most popular port scanner that is there on the Internet now you can use this on Linux on Windows and

03:51.680 --> 03:53.240
on all operating systems.

03:53.270 --> 03:59.330
It actually comes in installed with Nat hunters so you can run if you know how to use and you can actually

03:59.330 --> 04:04.400
run the commands using the command line in that Hunter and you'll be able to get the results or you

04:04.400 --> 04:10.400
can use Zanti and I'll show you in the next video is how you can actually use and map from within Zanti.

04:10.400 --> 04:17.180
And this is all the information that was able to get but you don't really need to go through this as

04:17.270 --> 04:21.440
it's already shown in the back in the main menu here.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.070
So basically what Zanti does Iran's and my for you.

04:24.170 --> 04:27.480
And then it shows you the results in a really nice and organized way.

04:27.590 --> 04:33.560
So what if you needed to go through the command line you have it by clicking on the maps counts as I

04:33.560 --> 04:36.830
showed you another device so I'm going to show you.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.880
Here is the next device I'm going to tap on it.

04:40.110 --> 04:46.160
The open ports as you can see there here port 80 9 0 2 4 9 1 5.

04:46.160 --> 04:52.540
Now we don't know what's running on this port site even if we come here on the unmap scans and I'm just

04:52.540 --> 04:55.180
going to look for that next device.

04:55.180 --> 04:59.720
So it's one 45 it's IP which is this one.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.770
So if you come here we can actually just see the open port.

05:02.800 --> 05:08.430
As you can see right here we have eighty nine 0 2 and 4 9 1 5 2.

05:08.530 --> 05:13.050
We don't know what what programs are on and on them like we can't see that 1862.

05:13.050 --> 05:14.240
It's usually hasty.

05:14.290 --> 05:19.150
So it's not a big deal like it didn't really tell us more information about it.

05:19.300 --> 05:25.240
So we'd like to know for example what server is not our port what version of that server so we can actually

05:25.240 --> 05:29.310
try and hack that computer through that server or through that port.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.270
Sorry.

05:31.310 --> 05:37.220
So I'll go back and I want to show you something like I mentioned that information gathering is one

05:37.220 --> 05:39.860
of the most important steps in penetration testing.

05:39.980 --> 05:45.170
And I wasn't overexaggerating it because let me show you this so I'm going to go on this suppled device

05:46.650 --> 05:48.220
and this is my own tablet.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.750
It's still broken.

05:50.230 --> 05:59.000
And as you can see we have to force open port number two to number 2 2 and 4 6 2 0 7 8.

05:59.020 --> 06:03.150
Now 1:56 usually corresponds to S-sh.

06:03.370 --> 06:08.190
So I'm going to go down here just to confirm and show you so 59.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.300
And here you are that's the IP of the Apple device.

06:14.410 --> 06:19.670
And as you can see that we have 4:22 22 open and it has hate support.

06:19.690 --> 06:22.360
So it's for us as a S-sh service.

06:22.360 --> 06:29.170
As I say it basically is a server that allows you to remotely run Linux commands on the target device.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.510
So it's usually installed on servers for example if you have a web server online when you buy a web

06:34.510 --> 06:38.500
server or rent a web server they'll give you an S-sh account.

06:38.590 --> 06:45.550
So S-sh by using it a certain username and password it will allow you to remotely log in to your Linux

06:45.610 --> 06:51.450
or Windows or even Marko's machine and run commands on the target machine.

06:52.270 --> 06:58.540
So when you jailbreak your device with Apple you use a name with when you jailbreak it.

06:58.540 --> 07:03.030
The root password is actually set to a l p i n e.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.170
So it's the default password.

07:05.170 --> 07:10.060
Most people don't know that and even the people that know that they don't change it including me.

07:10.060 --> 07:13.270
I actually never change it like I don't have this just to show you now.

07:13.330 --> 07:19.650
So when I just broke my device the password is still as a p i n.

07:19.810 --> 07:26.140
So for example when you're doing a scan and then you see an Apple device with port 22 open it's a good

07:26.140 --> 07:29.380
idea just to try to log in to that port with the password.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.930
A L P I N E.

07:30.940 --> 07:35.520
Now let me just do this quickly and show you how you can do this from your laptop or from your that

07:35.590 --> 07:36.670
Hunter device.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.770
I'm just going to do it from the net Hunter device.

07:38.890 --> 07:46.360
Just because we're doing penetration testing using your mobile phone or using your Android but you can

07:46.360 --> 07:48.600
do it from any device that you want.

07:48.610 --> 07:58.740
So I'm just going to go on the net and turn I'm going to go on home so I'm going to go on the luncher

07:59.250 --> 08:05.560
and I'm going to launch Kelly shell and terminal and all I have to do is S-sh into the target.

08:05.550 --> 08:16.320
So the come on this S-sh username is rude and you put it and then put the IP address of the target.

08:16.520 --> 08:25.350
So the IP address was 1 9 2 6 8 1 2009.

08:25.440 --> 08:32.720
I'm going to hit enter and it's telling me you want to trust target I'm going to say yes and now it's

08:32.720 --> 08:35.390
asking me for the password so I'm going to use the password.

08:35.390 --> 08:41.630
It's a L P and it's going to hit enter.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.960
And as you can see I logged in as root.

08:43.970 --> 08:54.170
So if I go you as you can see that I am rude and if I go if I can think just to show you that I am actually

08:54.170 --> 09:01.100
inside that device doesn't have it configured still I don't have that command installed on my tablet

09:01.510 --> 09:08.130
but it is as you can see that it's rude and it's arduous which is the name of the iPod.

09:08.390 --> 09:17.240
And if I say my eyes you can't say it's telling me that I am rude and I am at the target device.

09:17.660 --> 09:23.210
Basically you're just going to be using Unix commands to navigate through the system and you can do

09:23.210 --> 09:24.820
whatever you want because you are rude.

09:24.830 --> 09:30.920
And as I said it has all probably all privileges on the target machine.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.470
So this is basically like it wasn't an actual hack.

09:33.470 --> 09:39.690
It was just a use of information that we gather so we saw there an Apple device.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.570
Has S-sh open on it.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.340
So it was definitely broken.

09:43.490 --> 09:49.070
And we just tried the default password and we were able to log in and gain basic full access to this

09:49.070 --> 09:49.720
device.

09:49.730 --> 09:54.980
So even if this device had no exploit it had the latest and greatest software and the best security

09:54.980 --> 10:00.560
measurements we only logged in through a service which is allowed on the device used in proper username

10:00.560 --> 10:01.110
and password.
