1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:01,960
Right.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,800
So in this video we're just going to follow on what we did in the previous video.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,970
We're still using Zanti too and we're still connected to the same network and I have the same devices

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,410
connected here to the network.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,380
The only difference is that right now we're going to try and determine the actual programs running on

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,760
each port.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,640
So I'm going to go on my Linux device which is this one just because it has the most number of force

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,660
and we have three services running on port eighty nine 0 2 and 4 9 1 5 2.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,910
And as I showed you before when we go on the scans here you can see that the ports are open but you

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,000
can see what programs are running on these ports.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,120
So let me just show you here.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,330
As you can see here we can see that we have TTP and we have on nine or two that we have ISIS running.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,550
And then we have on 9 1 5 2 that are an unknown service is running.

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:05,560
So as I said what Zanti does it actually use is a very powerful tool called a mob and using that too

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,810
it can actually show us or get information about the connected devices.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,140
So we're going to go on the scan option here.

17
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,710
And what this does it basically allows us to run advanced scans on the target device.

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,600
So it's only going to rise on the device that we selected and not on the whole network.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,660
Now I'm going to go on the scanner type and as you can see there is a number of scans that you can on.

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,570
Now I'm not actually going to be around in all of this askance.

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,200
It's very simple to run them you basically just have the scan and it does what discount does.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,830
So there's no point of me just wasting time running each one of them.

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,700
I'm going to be around in just a few of them to show you how you can run a scan and what information

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,200
you'll be getting from each of these scans.

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:03,860
So you can see that we have a scan and quick detection trace route and regular scan all these scans

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,020
will basically show what show us more information that what we originally have right now.

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,660
So I'm not going to be around or any of these scans.

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,900
They're usually quick.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Those are your basic information like what we have right now.

30
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,480
What I'm going to be running though I'm going to be running an intense gun.

31
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,260
So this will basically show you extra information that what we have from last time it will show you

32
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:34,140
more information about the open court and the programs that are running on these open ports.

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,590
Now as you can see on top of it saying that it's mapping network again now give it it's time and then

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,380
we'll see what information we get.

35
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,470
Right so we can see that the manual scans completed as you can see there on top and you can do a scan

36
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,460
you can dismiss and see the log.

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,800
So I'm going to click on the log

38
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,530
and this is actually the output that was produced by Unmap.

39
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,330
As you can see the first thing that we were able to detect remember when we were seeing that the port

40
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,760
is 80 so we can see that the port is 80.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
It's open.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,720
So we were able to get all that before.

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,690
But what we have now is the exact program and version on and go on this program so we can see that we

44
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,950
have Apache hasty TPD to point two point twenty two.

45
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,750
And it's right on your want or so before we only knew that it's Linux.

46
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,200
Now we actually know it's running on Ubuntu.

47
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,750
So it's this is the XYZ virgin of Linux and we know that it's Apache.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,730
The exact version of the program

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:56,360
we can also see the 9 0 2 port that is running on SSL VM where authentication daemon.

50
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:03,240
If we go on this port for 9 1 5 2 again before we didn't know it was just unknown what it's running.

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,190
Now we actually know that it's running media on UPMC.

52
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,930
So this is a media server running and we have the exact version of the server so we can actually go

53
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,840
now and look for exploits or default passwords or stuff like that for this server.

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,650
And we can see that it's running on Linux three point to point 0 7 non-generic and that is the kernel

55
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,840
version of the Linux of the operating system that the machine is running.

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,070
And then you can see it actually has the mac address and the operating system and all that kind of stuff.

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,240
And it also performs a trace route on the device as you can see here and we can see it's only one hop

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,020
away because we are on the same network.

59
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,720
Right so other showed you there's a number of scans you can pick any scan you want to experiment with

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,070
them and each one of them will give you maybe more information than another one.

61
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,550
So and math is a huge tool like there is for courses the only talk about and map.

62
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,050
So if you're really interested into penetration testing I'd highly recommend that you go and learn more

63
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,040
about and map.

64
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,440
As I said you can learn.

65
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,380
You can run and map commands from the terminal straightaway using the Kelly terminal right here.

66
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,800
Or you can just use Zanti which basically run and map commands for you and show them to you in an easy

67
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,750
and nice way.
