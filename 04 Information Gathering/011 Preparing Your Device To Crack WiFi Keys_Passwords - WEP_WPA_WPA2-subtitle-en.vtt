WEBVTT

00:05.440 --> 00:12.950
After doing wardriving and targeted a certain network in many cases our target would not be open so

00:12.950 --> 00:19.930
the network would be using a certain type of encryption whether it's WPP WPA or WPA too.

00:20.090 --> 00:25.760
Now there are a number of methods to crack each type of encryption before you can do that.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.950
There is a number of concepts that you have to learn about networks and how they work and how each one

00:30.950 --> 00:35.790
of these encryptions work and communicate with the devices that are connected to it.

00:37.670 --> 00:43.850
I actually have a full course explaining how to crack network Keys starting from scratch talking about

00:43.850 --> 00:49.270
these concepts about money or mode and MAC address all these things how they communicate with each other.

00:49.400 --> 00:56.750
And then I explain a practical attacks against each one of these incorruption so against WEP or WPA

00:56.770 --> 01:04.840
to the cracking method is exactly the same whether you do it from a Linux device or whether you do it

01:04.840 --> 01:11.740
from your net or because you'd be using the exact same tools which are aircraft ngi and reversed.

01:11.860 --> 01:16.780
So when you're going to be cracking and you will be running exactly the same commands whether you're

01:16.780 --> 01:20.800
doing it from a laptop or if you're doing it from your Android device.

01:21.040 --> 01:27.130
Therefore I kind of thought if I explained it from to do how to do it from Android device it would be

01:27.130 --> 01:32.260
going kind off topic because it's not really something special about Android devices.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.650
It's not a special attack that is made for Android devices.

01:35.770 --> 01:38.560
And also I'd be repeating myself.

01:38.670 --> 01:43.790
So if you're interested in to learn how to do that then have a look on my course on this link.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.180
And I'll also put it in the air resources if you like it.

01:48.180 --> 01:53.010
I'll give you 10 I'll give it to you for only $10 because you're already about one of my courses so

01:53.010 --> 01:55.500
I'm not going to charge you for the next one.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.540
I'm not going to charge you a lot for the next one.

01:57.600 --> 02:04.470
So it's a full course it has about I think 25 video starting from scratch to all the powerful methods

02:04.530 --> 02:06.820
that you can use to crack these interruptions.

02:08.310 --> 02:15.300
In order to do this from your Android device Unfortunately the Wi-Fi card inside Android devices is

02:15.300 --> 02:21.790
not very powerful so you need a Wi-Fi card that supports injection and supports monitor mode.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.270
So an example is the alpha a USA 6.

02:27.320 --> 02:33.680
It's very cheap and powerful and you can use it to do that in order to connect it to your tab and to

02:33.680 --> 02:35.360
your tablet or to your phone.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.810
You're going to need an OT G Y cable.

02:38.970 --> 02:43.570
So he actually won an RTG by cable looks like.

02:43.680 --> 02:49.300
So that's what it looks like it has basically connect to your USP.

02:49.480 --> 02:54.120
Here so you can that you can you don't have to connect the wireless card you can connect anything that

02:54.120 --> 02:56.730
connects using USV to this part.

02:56.820 --> 03:03.060
Then you connect this part to your phone and you connect this to your cable to charge the phone so the

03:03.060 --> 03:08.960
phone will be charge and at the same time you will need this when you're using the Wi-Fi when you're

03:08.960 --> 03:15.260
using a wife ID card because it takes a lot of power and the battery inside some of these mobile devices

03:15.260 --> 03:16.660
cannot support it.

03:16.670 --> 03:23.450
So that's why we save just get a white cable and get non-fact card and I'll show you how you connect

03:23.450 --> 03:25.170
it to your Android device.

03:25.270 --> 03:31.100
So that's because that's the only difference between computers and Android devices is just Kinect in

03:31.100 --> 03:32.150
your.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.490
Once it's connected.

03:33.490 --> 03:35.770
The attacks are exactly the same.

03:36.250 --> 03:42.100
So get your cable connected as I showed you now two seconds ago in the picture.

03:42.150 --> 03:49.500
I'll actually before we do that launch my terminal and the command that you use to see your wireless

03:49.500 --> 03:58.480
card is really you can think so I'm going to run that and as you can see that I have my wireless card

03:58.840 --> 04:00.760
right here is called

04:04.550 --> 04:05.690
nonzero.

04:05.850 --> 04:15.120
And as you can see it's connected to my network too so I'm going to connect my RTG cable Make sure you

04:15.120 --> 04:21.250
connect your wireless carrier to the RTG cable and then connect it to the power source first then connect

04:21.280 --> 04:22.700
it to your Android device.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.010
So the last step is connecting it to your Android device.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.940
Once you do that I'm going to do either config again

04:32.950 --> 04:42.220
and as you can see that I have my loved one connected right now so that is my wireless card my Alfar

04:42.220 --> 04:44.150
card that supports injection.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.340
So I'll just show you how to do wardriving using this card.

04:48.340 --> 04:54.590
Now you'll see actually we're going to detect so many more networks more than what we did with the internal

04:54.590 --> 04:57.310
one simply because this is a more powerful card.

04:57.440 --> 05:04.010
So I'm going to do Ehrmann Now again all these modes and all these commands are explained in much more

05:04.010 --> 05:06.810
detail in my course about tracking kids.

05:07.720 --> 05:13.480
So everyone ngi basically just the tool that allows you to start to monitor mode on cards again monitor

05:13.480 --> 05:18.460
mode and all these modes are explained in the car so I'm not going to go into detail now so I don't

05:18.460 --> 05:22.090
want and you start I'm going to start with the card which is none one

05:29.500 --> 05:32.690
and now the cards are dead on the line 1 1.

05:32.730 --> 05:37.010
So and then I'm going to do a road dump.

05:37.110 --> 05:40.580
So these commands are exactly the same you run them from your laptop.

05:40.590 --> 05:45.230
So basically if you learn how to do it on your own computer you can do it on Android.

05:45.240 --> 05:50.870
And if you learn how to do it on Android you can do it on computers so heire don't angry.

05:50.880 --> 05:58.530
I'm going to put my wireless card name with weiter mode so it's LAN one 1 and I'm just going to reduce

05:58.950 --> 05:59.470
the font.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.900
Because this is going to produce a lot of output and it's you won't be able to see all of it.

06:04.830 --> 06:07.230
So I'm just going to make the phone smaller

06:11.970 --> 06:12.970
and I'm going to enter

06:16.260 --> 06:22.010
and as you can see it's already getting so much more networks than we were able to get with Wi-Fi and

06:22.070 --> 06:22.700
Lizer.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.350
It's because we're using a more powerful wireless card.

06:30.960 --> 06:36.470
So you can see here you have the MAC address you have the power which is the distance of each of these

06:36.470 --> 06:40.310
A-P is how far it is from you.

06:40.340 --> 06:44.300
This is the beacons which each router sends the amount of data.

06:44.300 --> 06:54.970
So that's the useful packets the time the Janno the speed of each of them the encryption and then the

06:55.030 --> 07:01.930
algorithm that's used in the encryption the authentication type and the network name and also shows

07:01.930 --> 07:06.940
you the devices that are connected to this network if we if we started on a certain network or if we

07:06.940 --> 07:14.620
wait for it for a little bit again all of this is explained in much more detail onto my wife Vikki cracking.

07:14.700 --> 07:19.800
I didn't want to go into detail here again because it's not something special to Android devices and

07:19.800 --> 07:21.450
it didn't want to go off topic.

07:21.510 --> 07:28.470
Also because it's relatively big subject so it will distract you a bit if I start talking about it right

07:28.470 --> 07:29.050
now.

07:29.070 --> 07:31.550
So if you are interested in it send me a message.

07:31.590 --> 07:36.840
I will give you that course for only $10 and then you can do the attacks from your laptop or from your

07:36.840 --> 07:37.480
Android device.
