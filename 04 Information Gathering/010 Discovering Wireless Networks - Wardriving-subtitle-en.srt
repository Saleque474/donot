1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,140
So now we're going to talk about information gathering information gathering is one of the most important

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,860
steps in penetration testing.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:18,890
For example say if you're trying to gain access to a computer that exists on a certain network first

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,190
of all you want to be able to gather as much information as possible about that network so that you

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,790
can connect to it whether it uses encryption.

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,330
How far the network is what kind of security is being used on that network.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,580
The IP address the MAC address all that kind of stuff about the network once you can actually connect

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,590
to the network you want to be able to gather information about the devices that exist on this network.

9
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,280
Once you gather information about these devices you want to see which one of them is your target once

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,310
you locate your target you want to be able to know what IP address it is.

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,640
What operating system neurons doesn't run Windows does or on Linux.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,190
Is it a phone.

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,500
If it's a Windows version of Windows.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,000
If you get the version you want to see once you know the version you might be able to look for buffer

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,570
overflow exploits and think in full access to that laptop.

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,890
That's just an example.

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,350
So information gathering is very important the more information that you gather the more likely that

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,450
you will be able to gain access to your target and achieve your goal.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,810
So today or in this lecture we're going to talk about network discovery or what's known as wardriving

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,920
now basically wardriving is where you have your device and you'd be walking or driving around the area

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:43,240
that you think that your target is and or the network is in and gather information about these networks.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:50,530
So we're going to use an app called Wi-Fi analyzer which gives us information about old Wi-Fi networks

23
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,830
or are around us.

24
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,060
So it gives us information about the network name gives us information about the MAC address the channel

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:05,440
the encryption the speed the signal strength and it even shows us the devices that each network or the

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,020
devices that are connected to our current network.

27
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,550
We'll talk about that in the next class.

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,840
So I'm just going to go to my calculator next device right here and you can download this app from the

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
App Store.

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,320
So as you can see here I have it right here.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Wi-Fi analyzer.

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,810
So I'm just going to tap it

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,240
and as you can see straight away it's showing me the networks that are around me and we can see that

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,780
there are four networks and two or two has the strongest signal.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,880
That's because this is the one that actually connected to right now.

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,830
And then you can see the rest is fluctuating because there actually none of them is my network.

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,830
The other one is blue.

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,090
It's not very well visible.

39
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,560
This is one of my networks as well.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,250
That's what it is.

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,410
It's a bit strong.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,990
So this curve basically shows you the signal strength of all the networks around you

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,930
so I'm going to tap on the view here on top and I'm going to go to the time graph

44
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,540
this will basically show you the signal strength across time.

45
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,370
And as you can see it's moving.

46
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:23,240
So you can see which networks are consistent and which networks aren't on top.

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,020
You can filter networks by clicking on the network name on top.

48
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,470
So for example if I click on horizon right there

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,930
it's going to highlight it for me.

50
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,490
So if you click on UPC you 4 1 1 1 9 you can see it's highlighted there for me so you can have a better

51
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,620
look at it.

52
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,030
So I'm going to look for my network which is to you y2 and I'm highlighting it right there and you can

53
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,710
see it is the one with the strongest signal and the most consistent of all of them.

54
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:05,410
Now the other view that we have is the channel rating and it'll basically show you which channels are

55
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,790
being used most.

56
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,930
Now this is actually really handy because if you go back I'm just going to go back to the channel graph

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,580
right here.

58
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:23,140
You can see that my network is both of my networks actually to Aitu and the UPC 1:54 are both on the

59
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,520
same channel but they are not used in any of the channels that are used by other networks.

60
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,720
By doing this I can actually avoid overlapping.

61
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,830
And I'll have a stronger signal in my house for my networks.

62
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:42,040
Now I have them both run on the same channel because the y2 is just experimental or a temporary network

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,030
that I only use when I'm making videos.

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,540
So usually I don't use both.

65
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,590
I'd use one or the other.

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,460
So that's why I have them on the same channel.

67
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,450
But a good tip for you if there is a lot of networks running on the same channel around your area then

68
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,830
it's a good idea to change the channel of your network to another channel.

69
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:07,690
So I'm going to go now to the AP list and this will basically give you a really comprehensive and good

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,380
look of all the network so it'll show you the MAC address here on top as you can see.

71
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,930
So that's the physical address of each network.

72
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,170
This doesn't change and it always stays the same

73
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,790
and also shows you the channel it shows you the speed and it shows you the encryption or the security

74
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,850
you so you can see this network my network uses WPA if ask yes.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,580
OK.

76
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,280
If you go down you'll see actually all of them are using WPA at the moment.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,020
You can also see your current address because I'm actually connected to this network so you can see

78
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,800
my current IP address here.

79
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,390
And the last one which is one of the really nice features that I like about this app is the signal meter.

80
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:13,560
Now this is really handy because it shows you how strong is the signal of the network that you pick.

81
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,720
So from here if you tap on this you can pick any network strong networks around.

82
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,390
So I'm going to pick to you to for example and we can see that the signal is full so it's perfect.

83
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:30,120
Now if you start moving around the signal is going to change so it's really good say if you're in a

84
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,630
place and then you're trying to see what is the part that has the best coverage or the strongest signal

85
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,850
in that place.

86
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,990
Then you can basically just pick the network that you want and start walking around or moving around

87
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,510
until you find the area where the strongest signal.

88
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,780
Now this comes in really really handy when you're trying to break into kids whether it's WPA or WAPT

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,600
is you usually want as part with a really good signal

90
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,270
even if you're using your laptop in order to do that.

91
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,890
It's really handy to use your phone or your tablet and start moving around to find the place with the

92
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,260
strongest signal and then put your laptop there or put your wife I card there and start trying to break

93
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,510
into that network.

94
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:26,170
We will talk about break in kids whether it's the blue WPA or WPA to and stronger or in the future lectures.

95
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,570
But I just would like to point that this will come in really really handy when you're trying to do this

96
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,230
and you'll see it in the future when you actually try to do some tests.

97
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,630
It's really difficult to get.

98
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,230
Or it's really important to get a place with a good signal.

99
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,510
And this will help you to do that.

100
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,450
And it's going to be really really useful.
