1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,590
Now we're going to talk about something called network mapping.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,930
So let's say you're connected to a network or you connected to your target network and now you want

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,360
to discover all the connected devices to this network so there might be five six or ten devices connected

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
to this network and you want to gather information about these devices you want to know their IP address

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,100
and MAC address their operating system and maybe even the programs that are running on these devices.

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,330
All this information will make achieving your target easier.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,300
So if you know what operating system runs you can look for exploits for the operating system.

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,810
If you can see for example ports 21 open maybe you'll try to connect to it through FCP and see if there

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,250
is an anonymous account.

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:52,220
If not try to see what FGP server is running and look for buffer overflow exploits and maybe try to

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,230
exploit them maybe even if you find local exploits you can send something to the target person and way

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,210
to gain access to the device.

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,990
Well will going to talk about all that later but for now we're just going to see how we can gather information

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,210
about these devices see what services they're running and maybe try to gain access to these devices.

15
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,370
So I'm going to show you a few ways or a few apps that you can use to do that.

16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,000
We're going to start by the simplest and the ones that give you less information but they're quick and

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,970
then we're going to go to the more complicated more advanced apps.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,830
So for a start just to get an idea of what network mapping is I'm going to use the same apps that we

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,080
used before Wi-Fi analyzer.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,860
So I'm just going to tap on it.

21
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,680
And right now I'm actually connected to my network.

22
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,190
So if we go to the AP list you can see that I'm connected to you Aitu

23
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,190
so I'm going to go here on this three dots right there and I'm going to go on tools.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm going to tap on LAN neighbors so this will basically look through all the connected devices and

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,300
it'll show me information about these devices.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,780
Now first of all they can actually see some info about the current network so you can see the IP of

27
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,500
the gateway the IP of the gateway basically means the IP of the router or the server of this network.

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,230
So this is where whenever any device wants to access something within the network it's going to send

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,410
its request here.

30
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:32,850
So if it wants to access any web site or anything it's going to send that request to this IP.

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,330
You can also see the mosque and the network say so this is all the possible IPs that you can find within

32
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,990
the network.

33
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:51,950
And that's basically the range that specifies the range which is from 1 9 1 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 2 1 9 2

34
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,200
1 6 8 1 2 5 4.

35
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,040
If you look up the first one now we know the gateway is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1.

36
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,500
So if we look at the first device we can see that this has the same IP.

37
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,910
So that must be our outer or our server for the network and you can see that its KCC so its made by

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,600
HTC it was able to detect that.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,840
And then when we look on the other device right here we can see that we have one device connected to

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,790
the network and thats 1 9 2 1 6 8 145 and the username is as 00 us.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,830
And that's actually my Linux machine right here.

42
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:38,730
So I'll just show you that if I open my terminal you can see that the name of my machine is as 00 as.

43
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,430
So I was able to find the name of this machine because it's connected to the same network so I was able

44
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,160
to get that.

45
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:54,190
It also got me my mac address right here so I'm going to show you that this is correct so if I go become

46
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,690
thick and this is my wireless card ifconfig de-th one

47
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,280
as you can see the MAC address is actually the same.

48
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,610
So it was able to get the MAC address of this device as well.

49
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:22,070
It was also able to get the manufacturer of my wireless card which is this right here.

50
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:29,320
Now I'm going to go back and if you go on the or you I look up from the tools they will basically just

51
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,370
tell you the manufacturer of any device used in the MAC address.

52
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,800
Now the device has to be connected to your network.

53
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,850
So I'm just going to do the same it already got this for me so I'm just going to do it just to show

54
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,670
you.

55
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,210
So I'm just going to put the MAC address of my laptop which is zero

56
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,810
8 5 and I can see it I actually got it already right here.

57
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,310
So that's it for now.

58
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,440
Very simple too.

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,600
It allows you to discover all the connected device in your network now and the future videos we're going

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,120
to be using more advanced tools and we'll see that they'll actually show us much more information than

61
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:19,600
this to.
