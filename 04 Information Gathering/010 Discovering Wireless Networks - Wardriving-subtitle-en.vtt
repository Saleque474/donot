00:02.200 --> 00:08.140
So now we're going to talk about information gathering information gathering is one of the most important

00:08.140 --> 00:10.860
steps in penetration testing.

00:10.910 --> 00:18.890
For example say if you're trying to gain access to a computer that exists on a certain network first

00:18.890 --> 00:25.190
of all you want to be able to gather as much information as possible about that network so that you

00:25.190 --> 00:27.790
can connect to it whether it uses encryption.

00:27.830 --> 00:32.330
How far the network is what kind of security is being used on that network.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.580
The IP address the MAC address all that kind of stuff about the network once you can actually connect

00:37.580 --> 00:43.590
to the network you want to be able to gather information about the devices that exist on this network.

00:43.670 --> 00:49.280
Once you gather information about these devices you want to see which one of them is your target once

00:49.280 --> 00:53.310
you locate your target you want to be able to know what IP address it is.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.640
What operating system neurons doesn't run Windows does or on Linux.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.190
Is it a phone.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.500
If it's a Windows version of Windows.

01:00.500 --> 01:05.000
If you get the version you want to see once you know the version you might be able to look for buffer

01:05.000 --> 01:08.570
overflow exploits and think in full access to that laptop.

01:08.900 --> 01:09.890
That's just an example.

01:09.890 --> 01:15.350
So information gathering is very important the more information that you gather the more likely that

01:15.350 --> 01:19.450
you will be able to gain access to your target and achieve your goal.

01:21.520 --> 01:28.810
So today or in this lecture we're going to talk about network discovery or what's known as wardriving

01:29.330 --> 01:35.920
now basically wardriving is where you have your device and you'd be walking or driving around the area

01:36.220 --> 01:43.240
that you think that your target is and or the network is in and gather information about these networks.

01:43.270 --> 01:50.530
So we're going to use an app called Wi-Fi analyzer which gives us information about old Wi-Fi networks

01:50.530 --> 01:51.830
or are around us.

01:51.940 --> 01:58.060
So it gives us information about the network name gives us information about the MAC address the channel

01:58.060 --> 02:05.440
the encryption the speed the signal strength and it even shows us the devices that each network or the

02:05.440 --> 02:08.020
devices that are connected to our current network.

02:08.020 --> 02:11.550
We'll talk about that in the next class.

02:11.780 --> 02:17.840
So I'm just going to go to my calculator next device right here and you can download this app from the

02:17.840 --> 02:18.760
App Store.

02:18.860 --> 02:21.320
So as you can see here I have it right here.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.720
Wi-Fi analyzer.

02:22.730 --> 02:23.810
So I'm just going to tap it

02:27.860 --> 02:33.240
and as you can see straight away it's showing me the networks that are around me and we can see that

02:33.240 --> 02:37.780
there are four networks and two or two has the strongest signal.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.880
That's because this is the one that actually connected to right now.

02:40.920 --> 02:45.830
And then you can see the rest is fluctuating because there actually none of them is my network.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.830
The other one is blue.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.090
It's not very well visible.

02:48.090 --> 02:49.560
This is one of my networks as well.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.250
That's what it is.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.410
It's a bit strong.

02:53.640 --> 02:59.990
So this curve basically shows you the signal strength of all the networks around you

03:03.620 --> 03:07.930
so I'm going to tap on the view here on top and I'm going to go to the time graph

03:11.110 --> 03:15.540
this will basically show you the signal strength across time.

03:15.580 --> 03:17.370
And as you can see it's moving.

03:17.770 --> 03:23.240
So you can see which networks are consistent and which networks aren't on top.

03:23.240 --> 03:29.020
You can filter networks by clicking on the network name on top.

03:29.020 --> 03:32.470
So for example if I click on horizon right there

03:35.520 --> 03:36.930
it's going to highlight it for me.

03:38.230 --> 03:45.490
So if you click on UPC you 4 1 1 1 9 you can see it's highlighted there for me so you can have a better

03:45.490 --> 03:46.620
look at it.

03:46.690 --> 03:52.030
So I'm going to look for my network which is to you y2 and I'm highlighting it right there and you can

03:52.030 --> 03:57.710
see it is the one with the strongest signal and the most consistent of all of them.

03:57.710 --> 04:05.410
Now the other view that we have is the channel rating and it'll basically show you which channels are

04:05.410 --> 04:06.790
being used most.

04:06.790 --> 04:13.930
Now this is actually really handy because if you go back I'm just going to go back to the channel graph

04:14.080 --> 04:15.580
right here.

04:15.580 --> 04:23.140
You can see that my network is both of my networks actually to Aitu and the UPC 1:54 are both on the

04:23.140 --> 04:29.520
same channel but they are not used in any of the channels that are used by other networks.

04:29.710 --> 04:32.720
By doing this I can actually avoid overlapping.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.830
And I'll have a stronger signal in my house for my networks.

04:35.830 --> 04:42.040
Now I have them both run on the same channel because the y2 is just experimental or a temporary network

04:42.040 --> 04:44.030
that I only use when I'm making videos.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.540
So usually I don't use both.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.590
I'd use one or the other.

04:47.590 --> 04:49.460
So that's why I have them on the same channel.

04:49.670 --> 04:55.450
But a good tip for you if there is a lot of networks running on the same channel around your area then

04:55.450 --> 04:58.830
it's a good idea to change the channel of your network to another channel.

05:00.630 --> 05:07.690
So I'm going to go now to the AP list and this will basically give you a really comprehensive and good

05:07.700 --> 05:13.380
look of all the network so it'll show you the MAC address here on top as you can see.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.930
So that's the physical address of each network.

05:16.930 --> 05:19.170
This doesn't change and it always stays the same

05:25.090 --> 05:30.790
and also shows you the channel it shows you the speed and it shows you the encryption or the security

05:30.820 --> 05:35.850
you so you can see this network my network uses WPA if ask yes.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.580
OK.

05:39.540 --> 05:44.280
If you go down you'll see actually all of them are using WPA at the moment.

05:44.280 --> 05:49.020
You can also see your current address because I'm actually connected to this network so you can see

05:49.020 --> 05:50.800
my current IP address here.

05:59.570 --> 06:05.390
And the last one which is one of the really nice features that I like about this app is the signal meter.

06:05.420 --> 06:13.560
Now this is really handy because it shows you how strong is the signal of the network that you pick.

06:13.580 --> 06:17.720
So from here if you tap on this you can pick any network strong networks around.

06:17.720 --> 06:23.390
So I'm going to pick to you to for example and we can see that the signal is full so it's perfect.

06:23.450 --> 06:30.120
Now if you start moving around the signal is going to change so it's really good say if you're in a

06:30.120 --> 06:36.630
place and then you're trying to see what is the part that has the best coverage or the strongest signal

06:36.680 --> 06:37.850
in that place.

06:38.060 --> 06:42.990
Then you can basically just pick the network that you want and start walking around or moving around

06:43.350 --> 06:46.510
until you find the area where the strongest signal.

06:48.640 --> 06:54.780
Now this comes in really really handy when you're trying to break into kids whether it's WPA or WAPT

06:54.800 --> 06:58.600
is you usually want as part with a really good signal

07:01.460 --> 07:04.270
even if you're using your laptop in order to do that.

07:04.280 --> 07:09.890
It's really handy to use your phone or your tablet and start moving around to find the place with the

07:09.890 --> 07:15.260
strongest signal and then put your laptop there or put your wife I card there and start trying to break

07:15.380 --> 07:16.510
into that network.

07:17.350 --> 07:26.170
We will talk about break in kids whether it's the blue WPA or WPA to and stronger or in the future lectures.

07:26.390 --> 07:31.570
But I just would like to point that this will come in really really handy when you're trying to do this

07:31.570 --> 07:35.230
and you'll see it in the future when you actually try to do some tests.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.630
It's really difficult to get.

07:36.650 --> 07:39.230
Or it's really important to get a place with a good signal.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.510
And this will help you to do that.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.450
And it's going to be really really useful.
