1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,950
After doing wardriving and targeted a certain network in many cases our target would not be open so

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:19,930
the network would be using a certain type of encryption whether it's WPP WPA or WPA too.

3
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,760
Now there are a number of methods to crack each type of encryption before you can do that.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,950
There is a number of concepts that you have to learn about networks and how they work and how each one

5
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,790
of these encryptions work and communicate with the devices that are connected to it.

6
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:43,850
I actually have a full course explaining how to crack network Keys starting from scratch talking about

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,270
these concepts about money or mode and MAC address all these things how they communicate with each other.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:56,750
And then I explain a practical attacks against each one of these incorruption so against WEP or WPA

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:04,840
to the cracking method is exactly the same whether you do it from a Linux device or whether you do it

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,740
from your net or because you'd be using the exact same tools which are aircraft ngi and reversed.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,780
So when you're going to be cracking and you will be running exactly the same commands whether you're

12
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,800
doing it from a laptop or if you're doing it from your Android device.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,130
Therefore I kind of thought if I explained it from to do how to do it from Android device it would be

14
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,260
going kind off topic because it's not really something special about Android devices.

15
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,650
It's not a special attack that is made for Android devices.

16
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,560
And also I'd be repeating myself.

17
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,790
So if you're interested in to learn how to do that then have a look on my course on this link.

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,180
And I'll also put it in the air resources if you like it.

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,010
I'll give you 10 I'll give it to you for only $10 because you're already about one of my courses so

20
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,500
I'm not going to charge you for the next one.

21
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,540
I'm not going to charge you a lot for the next one.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,470
So it's a full course it has about I think 25 video starting from scratch to all the powerful methods

23
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,820
that you can use to crack these interruptions.

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,300
In order to do this from your Android device Unfortunately the Wi-Fi card inside Android devices is

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,790
not very powerful so you need a Wi-Fi card that supports injection and supports monitor mode.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,270
So an example is the alpha a USA 6.

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,680
It's very cheap and powerful and you can use it to do that in order to connect it to your tab and to

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
your tablet or to your phone.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,810
You're going to need an OT G Y cable.

30
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,570
So he actually won an RTG by cable looks like.

31
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,300
So that's what it looks like it has basically connect to your USP.

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,120
Here so you can that you can you don't have to connect the wireless card you can connect anything that

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,730
connects using USV to this part.

34
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,060
Then you connect this part to your phone and you connect this to your cable to charge the phone so the

35
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,960
phone will be charge and at the same time you will need this when you're using the Wi-Fi when you're

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,260
using a wife ID card because it takes a lot of power and the battery inside some of these mobile devices

37
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,660
cannot support it.

38
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:23,450
So that's why we save just get a white cable and get non-fact card and I'll show you how you connect

39
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,170
it to your Android device.

40
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,100
So that's because that's the only difference between computers and Android devices is just Kinect in

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,150
your.

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,490
Once it's connected.

43
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,770
The attacks are exactly the same.

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,100
So get your cable connected as I showed you now two seconds ago in the picture.

45
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:49,500
I'll actually before we do that launch my terminal and the command that you use to see your wireless

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:58,480
card is really you can think so I'm going to run that and as you can see that I have my wireless card

47
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,760
right here is called

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,690
nonzero.

49
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:15,120
And as you can see it's connected to my network too so I'm going to connect my RTG cable Make sure you

50
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,250
connect your wireless carrier to the RTG cable and then connect it to the power source first then connect

51
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,700
it to your Android device.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,010
So the last step is connecting it to your Android device.

53
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,940
Once you do that I'm going to do either config again

54
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:42,220
and as you can see that I have my loved one connected right now so that is my wireless card my Alfar

55
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,150
card that supports injection.

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,340
So I'll just show you how to do wardriving using this card.

57
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,590
Now you'll see actually we're going to detect so many more networks more than what we did with the internal

58
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,310
one simply because this is a more powerful card.

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,010
So I'm going to do Ehrmann Now again all these modes and all these commands are explained in much more

60
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,810
detail in my course about tracking kids.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,480
So everyone ngi basically just the tool that allows you to start to monitor mode on cards again monitor

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,460
mode and all these modes are explained in the car so I'm not going to go into detail now so I don't

63
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,090
want and you start I'm going to start with the card which is none one

64
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,690
and now the cards are dead on the line 1 1.

65
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,010
So and then I'm going to do a road dump.

66
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,580
So these commands are exactly the same you run them from your laptop.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,230
So basically if you learn how to do it on your own computer you can do it on Android.

68
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,870
And if you learn how to do it on Android you can do it on computers so heire don't angry.

69
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,530
I'm going to put my wireless card name with weiter mode so it's LAN one 1 and I'm just going to reduce

70
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,470
the font.

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,900
Because this is going to produce a lot of output and it's you won't be able to see all of it.

72
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,230
So I'm just going to make the phone smaller

73
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,970
and I'm going to enter

74
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,010
and as you can see it's already getting so much more networks than we were able to get with Wi-Fi and

75
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,700
Lizer.

76
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,350
It's because we're using a more powerful wireless card.

77
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,470
So you can see here you have the MAC address you have the power which is the distance of each of these

78
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,310
A-P is how far it is from you.

79
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,300
This is the beacons which each router sends the amount of data.

80
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:54,970
So that's the useful packets the time the Janno the speed of each of them the encryption and then the

81
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,930
algorithm that's used in the encryption the authentication type and the network name and also shows

82
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,940
you the devices that are connected to this network if we if we started on a certain network or if we

83
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:14,620
wait for it for a little bit again all of this is explained in much more detail onto my wife Vikki cracking.

84
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,800
I didn't want to go into detail here again because it's not something special to Android devices and

85
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,450
it didn't want to go off topic.

86
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:28,470
Also because it's relatively big subject so it will distract you a bit if I start talking about it right

87
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,050
now.

88
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,550
So if you are interested in it send me a message.

89
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,840
I will give you that course for only $10 and then you can do the attacks from your laptop or from your

90
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,480
Android device.
