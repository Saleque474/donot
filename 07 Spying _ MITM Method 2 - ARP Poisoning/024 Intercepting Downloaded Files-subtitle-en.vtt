OK so we're still doing man in the middle and they are poison and using Zanti.

00:04.890 --> 00:12.930
And I'd like to show you one of the really cool features of Zanti this feature will allow us to capture

00:12.930 --> 00:14.000
any downloads.

00:14.220 --> 00:22.450
The target person does so whenever they download any file will be able to capture it and downloaded.

00:22.500 --> 00:30.150
So I'm just going to enable here capture downloads and I'm going to choose the type of file that I'd

00:30.150 --> 00:38.310
like to capture and it's going to be zip files now I'm going to go into the target device and download

00:38.400 --> 00:39.000
and Ziv

00:49.630 --> 00:56.990
So I'm just going to go ahead and look for something with Zip extensions so we have here I'm going to

00:56.990 --> 00:57.920
download it.

00:59.590 --> 01:00.160
Save it.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.730
So it's called 7 8 9 0 0 going to it.

01:03.740 --> 01:06.780
OK.

01:06.910 --> 01:10.940
Now Zanti should actually capture that and save it for me.

01:12.780 --> 01:16.010
Now all this stuff will be downloaded to SD card.

01:16.020 --> 01:22.240
So let's go to our file manager here and see if it actually was downloaded.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.780
So we have Zanti captures here.

01:26.920 --> 01:33.970
As you can see that I have my file right there so I can open it and see what's in there and it is the

01:33.970 --> 01:35.530
actual exactly the same file.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.800
So I'll just verify that for you here.

01:40.030 --> 01:44.520
It went in downloads or you can just open it here.

01:45.070 --> 01:47.410
And as you can see it's the same file.

01:47.570 --> 01:56.380
We managed to capture that.

01:56.560 --> 02:04.420
Now it's even cooler from intercepting downloads is or capturing downloads is replacing a downloaded

02:04.420 --> 02:06.130
file with something else.

02:06.130 --> 02:13.060
So for example let's imagine that the target person is trying to download some of axes some program.

02:13.390 --> 02:19.150
We can actually replace that program with a virus or a backdoor or anything that we want.

02:19.270 --> 02:27.970
So that's when the target person runs their program they actually run our backdoor so I'm going to go

02:27.970 --> 02:36.170
down and going to go on intercept downloads and enable that then I'm going to go on the settings.

02:36.370 --> 02:44.470
I'm going to change it to XP and then I'm going to select the X-C that I wanted to replace this stuff

02:44.470 --> 02:45.780
with.

02:45.780 --> 02:55.540
And I have a calculator here that I'm going to use.

02:55.580 --> 03:02.390
So now whenever a person tries to download any cxi file it's going to be replaced with what I selected

03:02.390 --> 03:05.050
here which is a calculator.

03:05.070 --> 03:13.820
So let's go here and I'm going to download 7 zip for Windows and the XP version.

03:13.970 --> 03:17.110
So I'm going to save that file and it's saved.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.820
Now why we want this.

03:18.980 --> 03:22.290
This should be a calculator and it should not be normal.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.680
So has a file.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.200
So I'm going to run it.

03:26.510 --> 03:33.820
And as you can see I got a calculator and instead of getting 7 zip.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.610
Now this is huge.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.740
We can actually use it in the future scenario.

03:39.310 --> 03:44.620
So this way you can actually backdoor any file that the target person downloads.

03:44.620 --> 03:49.780
So you're not going to be trying to send the person and trick them into downloading a file and then

03:49.930 --> 03:55.840
when they're on the file you get what you want you're going to just create your backdoor or virus or

03:55.840 --> 04:01.240
Kilowog or whatever it is and just wait for the target person to download something once they download

04:01.240 --> 04:07.960
that thing from under official website that they trust and they will want to run that program because

04:07.960 --> 04:10.980
they willingly downloaded it when they run it.

04:11.050 --> 04:16.630
They'll actually run your virus or your program instead of running the actual program that they downloaded.
