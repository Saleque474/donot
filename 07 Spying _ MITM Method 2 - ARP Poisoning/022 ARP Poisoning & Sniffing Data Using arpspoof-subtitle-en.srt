1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,350
So let's go now and see how we can actually run and IRP spoofing attack we're going to use a tool called

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,780
AARP spoof which is part owners who called this nerve.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:20,030
We've already used one tool of this Neph which was DNS spoof we use that to carry out a DNS spoofing

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,640
attack with the bad USP.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:32,610
Today we're going to use a piece proof to carry out an RPG poisoning attack this tool is very popular.

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,910
It's very easy to use and can be used from terminal and it's ported to most operating systems including

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,970
an iOS Android backoffice Windows Linux everywhere.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,590
That's why I'm going to explain it in this lecture once we actually use it.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,890
And this lecture we're now going to use it in next lectures we're going to use in something simpler

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,960
simpler but it's really handy to know how to use a piece proof.

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm just going to show you here.

12
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,850
I'm actually going to clear this window and I'm going to do a RPA to show you the AARP table.

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,750
This is our target machine here.

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:19,120
And you can see that my IP address for the access point or for the router or for the server is this

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,360
and the MAC address is this.

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,430
And this is how the spoofing is going to happen.

17
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,730
So once we actually do the AARP poisonings you will see that this MAC address changes to the address

18
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,790
to the MAC address of my card or my wireless card on my Android device.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,630
So I'm going to go back here to my Android device and I'm going to launch my terminal

20
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,400
before I determine terminal.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,300
I want to show you here that the name of my wireless card here as you can see is non-zero.

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,990
And my IP address is this.

23
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,170
We're not going to need the IP address but the name is non-zero.

24
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,440
So I'm going to launch Culley terminal

25
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm going to excuse

26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:21,730
I'm going to put my wireless card name after this which is 9 0 and then I'm going to put my targets.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,400
So we're actually going to execute this command twice the first time we're going to be poisoning the

28
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,530
client or the target device.

29
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,130
And then the next time we're going to be poisoning the access point or the server and the first time

30
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,570
we're going to be telling the the client that I'm the router or I am the server.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,730
And the second term we're going to be telling the server that I am the target device.

32
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,870
This was going to put us in the middle of the connection.

33
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,590
So we're going to do this using the IPs.

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,700
So I'm going to put the IP of the server which is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1.

35
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:05,310
And then I'm going to put the IP of my target device which is let's just have a look on it here.

36
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,030
So I'm just going to do I think

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,350
as you can see this is my IP address.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,670
So 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 4 1 want to put it back

39
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,290
and that's Ed and I'm going to run my second I'm not going to execute this right now.

40
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm just going to type in my second month

41
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:51,240
and the difference between this and the other one is that we're going to just change this to one and

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,280
we'll change the other one to two for one

43
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,400
and that's going to be my second command.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,220
And then the third command that we're going to run is just to allow the packets to flow through our

45
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,940
mouth through my device so that it doesn't drop the packets because if we don't do that then packets

46
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,980
will become they will come to my device and then the device will just drop them thinking that they cause

47
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,640
a threat.

48
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,160
So what we want to do we want the packets to flow through the device and we want our device to act like

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,910
a router.

50
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:45,110
So we're going to enable IP forwarding which is done using this command.

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,750
OK so all my commands are ready now I'm just going to execute them.

52
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,720
And before I do that I'll just go back and do the RPA to show you here.

53
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,370
Right.

54
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,670
So let's do our first command and hit enter.

55
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,850
And that's going to poison my client telling him that I am the router then I'm going to go do this and

56
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,540
tell the router that I am the client.

57
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,720
So now I should be in the middle and I'm going to do this earth command to allow packets through flow

58
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,840
through my device and not drop them.

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,580
Now I should be the man in the middle.

60
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:29,520
And to verify that this is the target device that we are targeting I'm going to run a RPA to show the

61
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,320
MAC address and notice the change here.

62
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,970
So we're still using the same IP for the router.

63
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,110
What this device thinks the router has this MAC address.

64
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:50,150
So as you can see it used to be this one and it was changed to this one.

65
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,710
And also note that this is the same MAC address for device have an IP 17.

66
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:04,300
So only by running a RPA you can actually see that this device with this IP is trying to do our people

67
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,850
isn't it.

68
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,710
Because it has the same MAC address as the router.

69
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,620
Now since our device since this device thinks we are the router anytime it tries to access any Web site

70
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:24,100
it's going to send the request to this device which is actually my Android device.

71
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,330
So that's going to place me in the middle which means that I'm going to be able to read draw up modify

72
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,130
the packets.

73
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,240
So right now you're actually the man in the middle.

74
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,160
You can do the tasks that we did use in WSP attacks.

75
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,320
You can go ahead and run teeshirt to sniff the packets.

76
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:49,610
You can run SSL strip to strip them and bypass Hastey CPS and you can run DNS spoof to do DNS spoofing.

77
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,840
You can do the scenarios that we did and we're going to do.

78
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,080
So basically are now the man in the middle you can do all the man in the middle attacks that we learned

79
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,220
before and do all that kind of fun stuff.
