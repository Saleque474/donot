1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,710
And this video and I were going to have on some of the other features of Zanti which is their place

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,890
and images so we saw how we can replace files.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,600
You can also replace images

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,500
you can select the image that you want to replace stuff with.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,730
So I'm just going to choose the color the next image right here and it's already enabled.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:39,540
So if I go back to my yahoo search for images and search for something all the images there will be

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,550
replaced by what I selected.

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,880
So the search for cars for example.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,410
So as you can see all the images that are loading here are the same image that we picked for in next

10
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,950
which means that all the images are being replaced with what we want.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,720
Again you can think of multiple ways to exploit this to yourself.

12
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,170
We're not actually doing exploitation as you noticed before even on replacing the downloaded files.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,350
We didn't do the full exploitation thing because I'm leaving that to the exploitation part of the course.

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,760
So we're only learning how we can do this how we can do it in the middle how we can do all that stuff.

15
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,590
And then in the future we'll see how we can combine these attacks to fully exploit our target machine.

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,390
So I'm going to disable this now and I'm going to show you the last feature of Zanti which is certain

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,070
HDMI code.

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:45,110
Now this can be really useful to replace parts of pages that we want or to do access attacks which basically

19
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,580
allow you to steal cookies.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,860
It's really simple.

21
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:56,900
You just tap on the on and then you put DHHS all access code or restaged them H.M.S. code that you want

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,520
to execute in here.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,950
And then here on the target machine if you just go anywhere this code will be executed.

24
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,870
So I'm just going to go to you who does come and then you'll see an alert coming up which is the code

25
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,330
that we added it should show on and Artane Zanti test as you can see Yahoo website Donne's doesn't say

26
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:17,910
that.

27
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:25,460
So the code was executed again you can do this to do multiple accesses attacks but I'm not actually

28
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,430
going to go deep into that because it's really not very it is useful in other situations.

29
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,040
But if you are the man in the middle you can do much more powerful attacks than this.
