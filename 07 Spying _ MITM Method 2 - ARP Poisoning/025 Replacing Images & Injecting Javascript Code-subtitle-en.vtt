00:02.960 --> 00:09.710
And this video and I were going to have on some of the other features of Zanti which is their place

00:09.710 --> 00:12.890
and images so we saw how we can replace files.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.600
You can also replace images

00:22.850 --> 00:25.500
you can select the image that you want to replace stuff with.

00:25.700 --> 00:31.730
So I'm just going to choose the color the next image right here and it's already enabled.

00:31.880 --> 00:39.540
So if I go back to my yahoo search for images and search for something all the images there will be

00:39.540 --> 00:41.550
replaced by what I selected.

00:41.550 --> 00:49.880
So the search for cars for example.

00:49.920 --> 00:56.410
So as you can see all the images that are loading here are the same image that we picked for in next

00:56.790 --> 01:00.950
which means that all the images are being replaced with what we want.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.720
Again you can think of multiple ways to exploit this to yourself.

01:04.730 --> 01:10.170
We're not actually doing exploitation as you noticed before even on replacing the downloaded files.

01:10.170 --> 01:16.350
We didn't do the full exploitation thing because I'm leaving that to the exploitation part of the course.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.760
So we're only learning how we can do this how we can do it in the middle how we can do all that stuff.

01:21.810 --> 01:27.590
And then in the future we'll see how we can combine these attacks to fully exploit our target machine.

01:28.880 --> 01:35.390
So I'm going to disable this now and I'm going to show you the last feature of Zanti which is certain

01:35.400 --> 01:37.070
HDMI code.

01:37.190 --> 01:45.110
Now this can be really useful to replace parts of pages that we want or to do access attacks which basically

01:45.110 --> 01:47.580
allow you to steal cookies.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.860
It's really simple.

01:48.860 --> 01:56.900
You just tap on the on and then you put DHHS all access code or restaged them H.M.S. code that you want

01:56.900 --> 01:58.520
to execute in here.

01:58.700 --> 02:03.950
And then here on the target machine if you just go anywhere this code will be executed.

02:03.950 --> 02:11.870
So I'm just going to go to you who does come and then you'll see an alert coming up which is the code

02:11.870 --> 02:17.330
that we added it should show on and Artane Zanti test as you can see Yahoo website Donne's doesn't say

02:17.330 --> 02:17.910
that.

02:17.930 --> 02:25.460
So the code was executed again you can do this to do multiple accesses attacks but I'm not actually

02:25.460 --> 02:31.430
going to go deep into that because it's really not very it is useful in other situations.

02:31.430 --> 02:36.040
But if you are the man in the middle you can do much more powerful attacks than this.
