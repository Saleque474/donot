WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:09.350
So let's go now and see how we can actually run and IRP spoofing attack we're going to use a tool called

00:09.380 --> 00:13.780
AARP spoof which is part owners who called this nerve.

00:13.970 --> 00:20.030
We've already used one tool of this Neph which was DNS spoof we use that to carry out a DNS spoofing

00:20.030 --> 00:22.640
attack with the bad USP.

00:22.760 --> 00:32.610
Today we're going to use a piece proof to carry out an RPG poisoning attack this tool is very popular.

00:32.620 --> 00:38.910
It's very easy to use and can be used from terminal and it's ported to most operating systems including

00:38.930 --> 00:42.970
an iOS Android backoffice Windows Linux everywhere.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.590
That's why I'm going to explain it in this lecture once we actually use it.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.890
And this lecture we're now going to use it in next lectures we're going to use in something simpler

00:51.000 --> 00:58.960
simpler but it's really handy to know how to use a piece proof.

00:59.030 --> 01:00.900
I'm just going to show you here.

01:00.980 --> 01:07.850
I'm actually going to clear this window and I'm going to do a RPA to show you the AARP table.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.750
This is our target machine here.

01:11.860 --> 01:19.120
And you can see that my IP address for the access point or for the router or for the server is this

01:19.760 --> 01:22.360
and the MAC address is this.

01:22.660 --> 01:24.430
And this is how the spoofing is going to happen.

01:24.430 --> 01:30.730
So once we actually do the AARP poisonings you will see that this MAC address changes to the address

01:30.730 --> 01:35.790
to the MAC address of my card or my wireless card on my Android device.

01:37.280 --> 01:44.630
So I'm going to go back here to my Android device and I'm going to launch my terminal

01:47.290 --> 01:48.400
before I determine terminal.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.300
I want to show you here that the name of my wireless card here as you can see is non-zero.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.990
And my IP address is this.

01:55.990 --> 02:01.170
We're not going to need the IP address but the name is non-zero.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.440
So I'm going to launch Culley terminal

02:06.190 --> 02:07.360
I'm going to excuse

02:11.890 --> 02:21.730
I'm going to put my wireless card name after this which is 9 0 and then I'm going to put my targets.

02:21.760 --> 02:27.400
So we're actually going to execute this command twice the first time we're going to be poisoning the

02:27.850 --> 02:30.530
client or the target device.

02:30.850 --> 02:36.130
And then the next time we're going to be poisoning the access point or the server and the first time

02:36.130 --> 02:41.570
we're going to be telling the the client that I'm the router or I am the server.

02:41.680 --> 02:45.730
And the second term we're going to be telling the server that I am the target device.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.870
This was going to put us in the middle of the connection.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.590
So we're going to do this using the IPs.

02:51.700 --> 02:58.700
So I'm going to put the IP of the server which is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1.

02:59.170 --> 03:05.310
And then I'm going to put the IP of my target device which is let's just have a look on it here.

03:05.330 --> 03:07.030
So I'm just going to do I think

03:10.680 --> 03:13.350
as you can see this is my IP address.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.670
So 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 4 1 want to put it back

03:23.540 --> 03:29.290
and that's Ed and I'm going to run my second I'm not going to execute this right now.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.180
I'm just going to type in my second month

03:43.740 --> 03:51.240
and the difference between this and the other one is that we're going to just change this to one and

03:51.240 --> 03:53.280
we'll change the other one to two for one

04:00.090 --> 04:02.400
and that's going to be my second command.

04:02.400 --> 04:08.220
And then the third command that we're going to run is just to allow the packets to flow through our

04:08.220 --> 04:14.940
mouth through my device so that it doesn't drop the packets because if we don't do that then packets

04:14.940 --> 04:19.980
will become they will come to my device and then the device will just drop them thinking that they cause

04:19.980 --> 04:20.640
a threat.

04:20.790 --> 04:26.160
So what we want to do we want the packets to flow through the device and we want our device to act like

04:26.160 --> 04:26.910
a router.

04:27.030 --> 04:45.110
So we're going to enable IP forwarding which is done using this command.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.750
OK so all my commands are ready now I'm just going to execute them.

04:48.770 --> 04:53.720
And before I do that I'll just go back and do the RPA to show you here.

04:55.100 --> 04:55.370
Right.

04:55.370 --> 04:58.670
So let's do our first command and hit enter.

04:59.150 --> 05:05.850
And that's going to poison my client telling him that I am the router then I'm going to go do this and

05:05.850 --> 05:09.540
tell the router that I am the client.

05:09.660 --> 05:15.720
So now I should be in the middle and I'm going to do this earth command to allow packets through flow

05:15.720 --> 05:18.840
through my device and not drop them.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.580
Now I should be the man in the middle.

05:20.580 --> 05:29.520
And to verify that this is the target device that we are targeting I'm going to run a RPA to show the

05:30.390 --> 05:34.320
MAC address and notice the change here.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.970
So we're still using the same IP for the router.

05:38.190 --> 05:42.110
What this device thinks the router has this MAC address.

05:42.350 --> 05:50.150
So as you can see it used to be this one and it was changed to this one.

05:50.150 --> 05:56.710
And also note that this is the same MAC address for device have an IP 17.

05:56.780 --> 06:04.300
So only by running a RPA you can actually see that this device with this IP is trying to do our people

06:04.300 --> 06:04.850
isn't it.

06:05.030 --> 06:08.710
Because it has the same MAC address as the router.

06:08.720 --> 06:16.620
Now since our device since this device thinks we are the router anytime it tries to access any Web site

06:16.980 --> 06:24.100
it's going to send the request to this device which is actually my Android device.

06:24.150 --> 06:30.330
So that's going to place me in the middle which means that I'm going to be able to read draw up modify

06:30.330 --> 06:31.130
the packets.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.240
So right now you're actually the man in the middle.

06:33.240 --> 06:37.160
You can do the tasks that we did use in WSP attacks.

06:37.170 --> 06:41.320
You can go ahead and run teeshirt to sniff the packets.

06:41.430 --> 06:49.610
You can run SSL strip to strip them and bypass Hastey CPS and you can run DNS spoof to do DNS spoofing.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.840
You can do the scenarios that we did and we're going to do.

06:52.890 --> 06:58.080
So basically are now the man in the middle you can do all the man in the middle attacks that we learned

06:58.080 --> 07:01.220
before and do all that kind of fun stuff.
