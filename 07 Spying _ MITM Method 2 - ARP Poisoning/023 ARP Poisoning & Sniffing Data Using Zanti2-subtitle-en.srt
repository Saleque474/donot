1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,200
Now that we know how to do IRP spoofing and becoming the man in the middle using a sharpie spoof we're

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,640
actually not going to use it anymore.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,820
As I said we're going to use a tool called Zanti to now actually use this before to discover all the

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,320
connected devices.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,620
We're going to see now how how to use it to do it in the middle attacks using HRP poisoning.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,700
So the first thing that we're going to see is how to sniff usernames and passwords.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,040
We did this before using the bad USPO attack with T-Sharon.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,870
Again you can actually use T-shirt.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,240
And here with a Arpey spoof like we did before and sniff usernames and passwords.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,210
But as I said now we're going to use another tool which actually makes it much easier.

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,780
So I'm going to run Zanti to here.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,920
As you can see it's already discovered all the devices and as you know we're actually attacking the

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,330
windows device today.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,510
So this is the Windows device here so I'm just going to tap it and then I'm going to go to the man in

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,950
the middle attacks here.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,210
And I'm just going to turn this on right now.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,550
Turn off the cell strip for now.

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:16,110
I'm going to turn this on and that will do a Arpey poisoning and place me in the middle of the connection.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,590
So that's go here.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:29,560
We'll just verify that by do and our P.A. And as you can see that the MAC address is changed to my MAC

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,510
address in my Carol-Lee Linux or in my NAT Hunter device.

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,140
So that means that the attack was executed successfully.

23
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:45,640
So I'm going to go to being dot com like we did before with the bad us we attack and then I'm going

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:55,330
to go to free site generator again because this all uses TTP.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,780
I'm going to log in with a fake account.

26
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,300
Just any name so I'm going to say Zayde.

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,670
Who does.

28
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,000
Com password.

29
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,130
One two three four five six.

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,680
Antar

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,640
and back here on our Nat Hunter device.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm going to go on view log requests

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,350
and as you can see here we can see the websites that were accessed.

34
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,070
So we can see that we accessed the Mozilla that network site which is Firefox's Web site.

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,500
And then we accessed domain of Google and then we accessed three sitemap generators here.

36
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:49,710
And as you can see here with we have accessed Bing dot com and as you can see here for a free site map

37
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,110
generator it's in yellow so it's highlighted for us and it says that we have one password in here so

38
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,950
that's what I meant.

39
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,410
It's easier like you don't need to open the packets file in Wireshark like we did before.

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:09,310
So I'm just going to tap this here and I'm going to swipe to the right to the passwords and you can

41
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,380
see that the user name was Zayde at Yahoo dot com.

42
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:22,350
And the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the user was trying to access every site map generator control panel

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,170
OK now you can swipe left to get the request so you get all the posts and get requests that we heard.

44
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,980
You can get the user agent so we can actually we know now the user uses Mozilla Firefox 5 so you can

45
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,510
again go ahead and look for exploits for this particular browser and try to attack that browser.

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,510
I'm going to go back right now and show you another feature of Zanti which is a cell Strip.

47
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,130
Now we saw before how we can do that manually how to how to use SSL strip manually.

48
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,700
That's why I actually like to teach you how to do stuff manually first because these ARBs and these

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,630
tools they do work well and they're nice but sometimes they fail.

50
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,650
So if you know how to do that stuff manually you can go ahead and do it manually.

51
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,650
If these apps fail.

52
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,700
So I'm just tap in here on SSL strip and says that it's on.

53
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:23,230
So we should be able to if we go to mailboat Yahoo dot com we should go to the normal Yahoo and not

54
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,710
the U.P.S. one.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,740
And we should be able to sniff the username and password.

56
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,120
So I'm going to do that.

57
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm going to mail that here.

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,480
Who can.

59
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,300
As you can see here on top we didn't go to the hasty tips one so we should be able to sniff this user

60
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,340
name and password.

61
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:50,070
So again I'm going to go again with Zayde going call the two at Yahoo dot com and the password I'm going

62
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,600
to make it.

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,310
Nine eight seven six five four now.

64
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,420
And again let's go back here.

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,720
Go on the you logged requests and as you can see again the Web site has come on in yellow.

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,460
We Tirpitz it so nice that there is one password navigate the passwords and you can see that the user

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,220
name is zayd and the password is what.

68
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,010
Nine eight seven six five four.

69
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,870
I really like the way this filters the username and password and makes it so easy to read and access.

70
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,980
This is the whole point of using your mobile.

71
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,610
You want to do stuff quickly so you either just save it on a on a file and analyze it from your laptop

72
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,760
or you want something like this that just gives you the information really quick.

73
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:48,070
Another feature that I want to show you and this video is just capturing the images.

74
00:05:48,290 --> 00:06:05,430
So let's just go to images that yahoo dot com and just search for anything so just say Kurds or whacko's.

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,550
Now we go back to our device and I'm going to stop on logged images.

76
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,380
And as you can see you can actually see all the images that showed up or that the person the target

77
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,100
person have seen or like accessed on his browser.

78
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:30,370
So just another easy nice feature to see.

79
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,720
Now you can also do DNS spoofing use in Zanti.

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:44,170
The only problem with DNS spoofing here is that it redirects all hash TTP to the target that you specify.

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,260
So you can't actually just redirect one Web site.

82
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:55,380
It's going to redirect all web sites or all requests to the website that you're going to put in here.

83
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,580
So that's why we're If you want to do DNS spoofing you're going to have to do with the same way we did

84
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,160
it with the bad you and the with the bad USPO attack because that way we can actually only hijack one

85
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,580
website or one domain which will make it more difficult to the target to know that they are being attacked

86
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:19,300
and it's also more professional and smarter because redirecting all the traffic is just really easy

87
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,660
to discover that you're actually trying to attack that person or that website.

88
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,360
So again if you want to do DNS spoofing I don't recommend using Zanti you can just go and do with the

89
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,130
same way we did it with the USPS tag.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,520
You just have to enable the Arpey poisoning here or do it with a piece proof like we did in Delight's

91
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,090
lecture and then do it with DNS spoof.
