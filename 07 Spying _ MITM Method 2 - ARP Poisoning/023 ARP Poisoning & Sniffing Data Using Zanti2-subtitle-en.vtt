WEBVTT

00:01.350 --> 00:07.200
Now that we know how to do IRP spoofing and becoming the man in the middle using a sharpie spoof we're

00:07.200 --> 00:08.640
actually not going to use it anymore.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.820
As I said we're going to use a tool called Zanti to now actually use this before to discover all the

00:14.820 --> 00:16.320
connected devices.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.620
We're going to see now how how to use it to do it in the middle attacks using HRP poisoning.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.700
So the first thing that we're going to see is how to sniff usernames and passwords.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.040
We did this before using the bad USPO attack with T-Sharon.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.870
Again you can actually use T-shirt.

00:31.890 --> 00:37.240
And here with a Arpey spoof like we did before and sniff usernames and passwords.

00:37.320 --> 00:42.210
But as I said now we're going to use another tool which actually makes it much easier.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.780
So I'm going to run Zanti to here.

00:44.850 --> 00:49.920
As you can see it's already discovered all the devices and as you know we're actually attacking the

00:49.920 --> 00:51.330
windows device today.

00:51.570 --> 00:57.510
So this is the Windows device here so I'm just going to tap it and then I'm going to go to the man in

00:57.510 --> 00:58.950
the middle attacks here.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.210
And I'm just going to turn this on right now.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.550
Turn off the cell strip for now.

01:07.610 --> 01:16.110
I'm going to turn this on and that will do a Arpey poisoning and place me in the middle of the connection.

01:18.050 --> 01:20.590
So that's go here.

01:20.870 --> 01:29.560
We'll just verify that by do and our P.A. And as you can see that the MAC address is changed to my MAC

01:29.560 --> 01:34.510
address in my Carol-Lee Linux or in my NAT Hunter device.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.140
So that means that the attack was executed successfully.

01:38.620 --> 01:45.640
So I'm going to go to being dot com like we did before with the bad us we attack and then I'm going

01:45.640 --> 01:55.330
to go to free site generator again because this all uses TTP.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.780
I'm going to log in with a fake account.

01:59.130 --> 02:03.300
Just any name so I'm going to say Zayde.

02:03.890 --> 02:04.670
Who does.

02:04.670 --> 02:07.000
Com password.

02:07.030 --> 02:09.130
One two three four five six.

02:09.150 --> 02:09.680
Antar

02:12.360 --> 02:15.640
and back here on our Nat Hunter device.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.000
I'm going to go on view log requests

02:24.300 --> 02:28.350
and as you can see here we can see the websites that were accessed.

02:28.350 --> 02:34.070
So we can see that we accessed the Mozilla that network site which is Firefox's Web site.

02:34.320 --> 02:41.500
And then we accessed domain of Google and then we accessed three sitemap generators here.

02:41.670 --> 02:49.710
And as you can see here with we have accessed Bing dot com and as you can see here for a free site map

02:49.710 --> 02:55.110
generator it's in yellow so it's highlighted for us and it says that we have one password in here so

02:55.350 --> 02:55.950
that's what I meant.

02:55.950 --> 03:01.410
It's easier like you don't need to open the packets file in Wireshark like we did before.

03:01.710 --> 03:09.310
So I'm just going to tap this here and I'm going to swipe to the right to the passwords and you can

03:09.310 --> 03:12.380
see that the user name was Zayde at Yahoo dot com.

03:12.580 --> 03:22.350
And the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the user was trying to access every site map generator control panel

03:23.750 --> 03:30.170
OK now you can swipe left to get the request so you get all the posts and get requests that we heard.

03:30.290 --> 03:36.980
You can get the user agent so we can actually we know now the user uses Mozilla Firefox 5 so you can

03:36.980 --> 03:43.510
again go ahead and look for exploits for this particular browser and try to attack that browser.

03:46.920 --> 03:52.510
I'm going to go back right now and show you another feature of Zanti which is a cell Strip.

03:52.530 --> 03:57.130
Now we saw before how we can do that manually how to how to use SSL strip manually.

03:57.270 --> 04:02.700
That's why I actually like to teach you how to do stuff manually first because these ARBs and these

04:02.700 --> 04:06.630
tools they do work well and they're nice but sometimes they fail.

04:06.630 --> 04:10.650
So if you know how to do that stuff manually you can go ahead and do it manually.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.650
If these apps fail.

04:12.660 --> 04:16.700
So I'm just tap in here on SSL strip and says that it's on.

04:16.770 --> 04:23.230
So we should be able to if we go to mailboat Yahoo dot com we should go to the normal Yahoo and not

04:23.220 --> 04:24.710
the U.P.S. one.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.740
And we should be able to sniff the username and password.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.120
So I'm going to do that.

04:29.130 --> 04:30.750
I'm going to mail that here.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.480
Who can.

04:34.550 --> 04:40.300
As you can see here on top we didn't go to the hasty tips one so we should be able to sniff this user

04:40.300 --> 04:41.340
name and password.

04:41.540 --> 04:50.070
So again I'm going to go again with Zayde going call the two at Yahoo dot com and the password I'm going

04:50.070 --> 04:50.600
to make it.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.310
Nine eight seven six five four now.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.420
And again let's go back here.

04:59.880 --> 05:07.720
Go on the you logged requests and as you can see again the Web site has come on in yellow.

05:07.840 --> 05:13.460
We Tirpitz it so nice that there is one password navigate the passwords and you can see that the user

05:13.460 --> 05:17.220
name is zayd and the password is what.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.010
Nine eight seven six five four.

05:20.180 --> 05:26.870
I really like the way this filters the username and password and makes it so easy to read and access.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.980
This is the whole point of using your mobile.

05:28.990 --> 05:34.610
You want to do stuff quickly so you either just save it on a on a file and analyze it from your laptop

05:34.760 --> 05:38.760
or you want something like this that just gives you the information really quick.

05:41.540 --> 05:48.070
Another feature that I want to show you and this video is just capturing the images.

05:48.290 --> 06:05.430
So let's just go to images that yahoo dot com and just search for anything so just say Kurds or whacko's.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.550
Now we go back to our device and I'm going to stop on logged images.

06:12.100 --> 06:18.380
And as you can see you can actually see all the images that showed up or that the person the target

06:18.380 --> 06:22.100
person have seen or like accessed on his browser.

06:24.170 --> 06:30.370
So just another easy nice feature to see.

06:30.610 --> 06:34.720
Now you can also do DNS spoofing use in Zanti.

06:34.720 --> 06:44.170
The only problem with DNS spoofing here is that it redirects all hash TTP to the target that you specify.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.260
So you can't actually just redirect one Web site.

06:47.500 --> 06:55.380
It's going to redirect all web sites or all requests to the website that you're going to put in here.

06:55.420 --> 07:00.580
So that's why we're If you want to do DNS spoofing you're going to have to do with the same way we did

07:00.580 --> 07:06.160
it with the bad you and the with the bad USPO attack because that way we can actually only hijack one

07:06.230 --> 07:12.580
website or one domain which will make it more difficult to the target to know that they are being attacked

07:12.910 --> 07:19.300
and it's also more professional and smarter because redirecting all the traffic is just really easy

07:19.300 --> 07:24.660
to discover that you're actually trying to attack that person or that website.

07:24.660 --> 07:30.360
So again if you want to do DNS spoofing I don't recommend using Zanti you can just go and do with the

07:30.360 --> 07:33.130
same way we did it with the USPS tag.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.520
You just have to enable the Arpey poisoning here or do it with a piece proof like we did in Delight's

07:38.550 --> 07:42.090
lecture and then do it with DNS spoof.
