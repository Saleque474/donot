1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,640
OK so we're still doing man in the middle and they are poison and using Zanti.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:12,930
And I'd like to show you one of the really cool features of Zanti this feature will allow us to capture

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,000
any downloads.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:22,450
The target person does so whenever they download any file will be able to capture it and downloaded.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,150
So I'm just going to enable here capture downloads and I'm going to choose the type of file that I'd

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:38,310
like to capture and it's going to be zip files now I'm going to go into the target device and download

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,000
and Ziv

8
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:56,990
So I'm just going to go ahead and look for something with Zip extensions so we have here I'm going to

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,920
download it.

10
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,160
Save it.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,730
So it's called 7 8 9 0 0 going to it.

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,780
OK.

13
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,940
Now Zanti should actually capture that and save it for me.

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,010
Now all this stuff will be downloaded to SD card.

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,240
So let's go to our file manager here and see if it actually was downloaded.

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,780
So we have Zanti captures here.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,970
As you can see that I have my file right there so I can open it and see what's in there and it is the

18
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,530
actual exactly the same file.

19
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,800
So I'll just verify that for you here.

20
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,520
It went in downloads or you can just open it here.

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,410
And as you can see it's the same file.

22
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:56,380
We managed to capture that.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,420
Now it's even cooler from intercepting downloads is or capturing downloads is replacing a downloaded

24
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,130
file with something else.

25
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,060
So for example let's imagine that the target person is trying to download some of axes some program.

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,150
We can actually replace that program with a virus or a backdoor or anything that we want.

27
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:27,970
So that's when the target person runs their program they actually run our backdoor so I'm going to go

28
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:36,170
down and going to go on intercept downloads and enable that then I'm going to go on the settings.

29
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:44,470
I'm going to change it to XP and then I'm going to select the X-C that I wanted to replace this stuff

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,780
with.

31
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:55,540
And I have a calculator here that I'm going to use.

32
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,390
So now whenever a person tries to download any cxi file it's going to be replaced with what I selected

33
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,050
here which is a calculator.

34
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:13,820
So let's go here and I'm going to download 7 zip for Windows and the XP version.

35
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,110
So I'm going to save that file and it's saved.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,820
Now why we want this.

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,290
This should be a calculator and it should not be normal.

38
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,680
So has a file.

39
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,200
So I'm going to run it.

40
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:33,820
And as you can see I got a calculator and instead of getting 7 zip.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,610
Now this is huge.

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,740
We can actually use it in the future scenario.

43
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,620
So this way you can actually backdoor any file that the target person downloads.

44
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,780
So you're not going to be trying to send the person and trick them into downloading a file and then

45
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,840
when they're on the file you get what you want you're going to just create your backdoor or virus or

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,240
Kilowog or whatever it is and just wait for the target person to download something once they download

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,960
that thing from under official website that they trust and they will want to run that program because

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,980
they willingly downloaded it when they run it.

49
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,630
They'll actually run your virus or your program instead of running the actual program that they downloaded.
