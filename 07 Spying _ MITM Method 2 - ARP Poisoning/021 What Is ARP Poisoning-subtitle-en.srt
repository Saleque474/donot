00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:09,430
This class and the next few classes we're going to learn about AARP poisoning our people is and it is

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,380
just another method of becoming the man in the middle.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:19,910
And a network in previous videos we so how we can use the bad USP attack where we physically connect

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,360
our Android device to a laptop or to a computer.

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,760
And by doing that we force all the traffic through our device which makes us the man in the middle.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Once we the man in the middle.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,020
We were able to intercept packets read them modify them drop them do all that kind of fun stuff.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,760
Now another method of becoming the man in the middle is using ARPU poisoning.

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,350
This is one of the most dangerous dangerous and effective attacks.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,160
It's very dangerous because you don't need to interact with the target device or at least the user will

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,210
not see that interaction.

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,600
So you're not going to need to physically plug your device you're not going to need to send anything

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,680
to the user.

14
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,200
You will be interacting with with the target device was all that interaction is going to happen in the

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,250
background so that the target person will not feel it will not even know that anything has happened.

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:26,860
This attack is possible because when AARP protocol was programmed or made them people did not pay attention

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,940
to the security side of the protocols.

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,340
So it's very simple it's very effective but it's not secure.

19
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,210
Therefore the attack is possible on all network enabled devices.

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,400
So whether the as long as the device uses DARPA protocol then you can attack that device using this

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,870
method.

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,160
So whether it's a phone a tablet or computer running Windows Linux iOS Marcos it doesn't matter as long

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
as it uses ARPU which all of them does.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,440
Then you can use HRP poisoning to become the man in the middle without sending anything to the target

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,460
device without interacting with the user and without physically interacting with the device.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,050
So let's understand and see how this attack works.

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,100
This is just a normal network.

28
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,890
And let's assume this is your home network.

29
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,720
So you have a device here.

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,020
That's the target device that we are trying to attack whenever it needs requests for example whenever

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,050
it needs to access Google or Yahoo or anything it sends the request to a server.

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,060
So the server this is your local router.

33
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,340
So it doesn't matter whether you're connected on Wi-Fi or use an Ethernet you're always connected to

34
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
a router.

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,520
So you're going to or a server in the network.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,520
So you're going to send your request to the server the server is what is connected to the Internet so

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,390
it's going to go.

38
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,750
It's going to go to the Internet.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,480
It's going to get you Google dot com then it's going to give you the reply back and then you'll have

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
Google does come on your computer.

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Now the problem with they R.P. is that each request or response is trusted.

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,600
So whenever you send requests and whenever you send a reply you receive a response you always like computers

43
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,940
always trust Data response or request so they don't identify or they don't verify the source where they

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,610
got the request from.

45
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,200
And this is going to come clear now and the next step.

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,730
So say for example when this device sent something to the router install it tell him that I am computer

47
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,460
number one for example the router is going to trust that this is computer number one without verifying

48
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,910
that this is actually computer number one.

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:59,730
The second problem is that the devices can actually accept responses without sending or request so this

50
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,010
device can actually accept responses even without sending requests.

51
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,980
So for example it can actually just get a response tell on him tell on this device something some information

52
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,740
and this device not only is just going to accept it it's also going to trust it.

53
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,080
It's not going to verify the information in there.

54
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,040
It's not going to verify the source of information.

55
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:28,240
So these are the main problems with HRP protocol.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,560
So since we can send responses and the device is going to trust whatever information sent in that response

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,350
we're going to send our response to the target device tell them that that I tell them that device that

58
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,000
I the router now because the device except responses is going to accept that response and because it's

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,110
not going to verify my identity it's going to trust me and it's going to treat me as thereafter now

60
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,030
the way I tell him that I am there router by just telling him that the MAC address of the router has

61
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,690
changed.

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,670
And this is the new MAC address.

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,250
Now the MAC address as we said it's physical.

64
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,860
It never changes show so it should always be the same but it's going to trust it here.

65
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,450
It's not going to even think about anything as long as I send a response because ARPU trusts everything

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,550
it's going to trust the response that I sent.

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,210
Now the next step we're going to do.

68
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,310
We're going to send another response to the router this time telling the router that I am the target

69
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,240
device.

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,340
So the router whenever it needs to send something to this device it's actually going to send it to me

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,310
instead of sending it to that device again because it accepts responses and because it doesn't verify

72
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,880
what information is there it's going to accept that and it's going to treat me as this device.

73
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,390
Now once we do this twice we've actually redirected the flow of packets.

74
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,240
So every time this device wants to do something it's going to think that I am the router.

75
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,470
So it's going to send the request to me.

76
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,380
Well I'm going to do I'm actually going to send the request to the router.

77
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,110
The router is going to go get me the request send it back to me because it thinks that I am this device

78
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,180
and then I'm going to forward that request to the target device.

79
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,940
So as you can see it's actually very simple.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,230
Two main issues with the protocol allow us to exploit our protocol and redirect the flow packets which

81
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,140
causes us becoming the man in the middle and ones who are are the man in the middle.

82
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,000
We can actually do all the attacks that we saw before and we'll see how we can do them in a different

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,180
way.

84
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,860
Now in the next lectures.
