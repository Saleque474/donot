00:02.390 --> 00:09.430
This class and the next few classes we're going to learn about AARP poisoning our people is and it is

00:09.440 --> 00:12.380
just another method of becoming the man in the middle.

00:12.380 --> 00:19.910
And a network in previous videos we so how we can use the bad USP attack where we physically connect

00:19.940 --> 00:23.360
our Android device to a laptop or to a computer.

00:23.630 --> 00:29.760
And by doing that we force all the traffic through our device which makes us the man in the middle.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.000
Once we the man in the middle.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.020
We were able to intercept packets read them modify them drop them do all that kind of fun stuff.

00:38.120 --> 00:44.760
Now another method of becoming the man in the middle is using ARPU poisoning.

00:45.130 --> 00:50.350
This is one of the most dangerous dangerous and effective attacks.

00:50.560 --> 00:57.160
It's very dangerous because you don't need to interact with the target device or at least the user will

00:57.160 --> 00:59.210
not see that interaction.

00:59.230 --> 01:04.600
So you're not going to need to physically plug your device you're not going to need to send anything

01:04.600 --> 01:05.680
to the user.

01:05.710 --> 01:11.200
You will be interacting with with the target device was all that interaction is going to happen in the

01:11.200 --> 01:17.250
background so that the target person will not feel it will not even know that anything has happened.

01:18.700 --> 01:26.860
This attack is possible because when AARP protocol was programmed or made them people did not pay attention

01:26.860 --> 01:28.940
to the security side of the protocols.

01:29.020 --> 01:34.340
So it's very simple it's very effective but it's not secure.

01:34.620 --> 01:40.210
Therefore the attack is possible on all network enabled devices.

01:40.290 --> 01:47.400
So whether the as long as the device uses DARPA protocol then you can attack that device using this

01:47.400 --> 01:47.870
method.

01:47.970 --> 01:56.160
So whether it's a phone a tablet or computer running Windows Linux iOS Marcos it doesn't matter as long

01:56.160 --> 01:58.640
as it uses ARPU which all of them does.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.440
Then you can use HRP poisoning to become the man in the middle without sending anything to the target

02:04.440 --> 02:10.460
device without interacting with the user and without physically interacting with the device.

02:13.560 --> 02:20.050
So let's understand and see how this attack works.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.100
This is just a normal network.

02:22.110 --> 02:24.890
And let's assume this is your home network.

02:25.090 --> 02:27.720
So you have a device here.

02:27.750 --> 02:34.020
That's the target device that we are trying to attack whenever it needs requests for example whenever

02:34.020 --> 02:39.050
it needs to access Google or Yahoo or anything it sends the request to a server.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.060
So the server this is your local router.

02:42.180 --> 02:47.340
So it doesn't matter whether you're connected on Wi-Fi or use an Ethernet you're always connected to

02:47.340 --> 02:48.180
a router.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.520
So you're going to or a server in the network.

02:51.540 --> 02:56.520
So you're going to send your request to the server the server is what is connected to the Internet so

02:56.520 --> 02:57.390
it's going to go.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.750
It's going to go to the Internet.

02:58.760 --> 03:04.480
It's going to get you Google dot com then it's going to give you the reply back and then you'll have

03:04.480 --> 03:08.080
Google does come on your computer.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.880
Now the problem with they R.P. is that each request or response is trusted.

03:12.880 --> 03:19.600
So whenever you send requests and whenever you send a reply you receive a response you always like computers

03:19.690 --> 03:27.940
always trust Data response or request so they don't identify or they don't verify the source where they

03:27.940 --> 03:29.610
got the request from.

03:29.860 --> 03:32.200
And this is going to come clear now and the next step.

03:32.200 --> 03:39.730
So say for example when this device sent something to the router install it tell him that I am computer

03:39.730 --> 03:45.460
number one for example the router is going to trust that this is computer number one without verifying

03:45.490 --> 03:49.910
that this is actually computer number one.

03:50.160 --> 03:59.730
The second problem is that the devices can actually accept responses without sending or request so this

03:59.730 --> 04:05.010
device can actually accept responses even without sending requests.

04:05.010 --> 04:10.980
So for example it can actually just get a response tell on him tell on this device something some information

04:11.340 --> 04:15.740
and this device not only is just going to accept it it's also going to trust it.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.080
It's not going to verify the information in there.

04:18.090 --> 04:21.040
It's not going to verify the source of information.

04:21.060 --> 04:28.240
So these are the main problems with HRP protocol.

04:28.280 --> 04:35.560
So since we can send responses and the device is going to trust whatever information sent in that response

04:36.960 --> 04:43.350
we're going to send our response to the target device tell them that that I tell them that device that

04:43.380 --> 04:50.000
I the router now because the device except responses is going to accept that response and because it's

04:50.000 --> 04:58.110
not going to verify my identity it's going to trust me and it's going to treat me as thereafter now

04:58.110 --> 05:03.030
the way I tell him that I am there router by just telling him that the MAC address of the router has

05:03.030 --> 05:03.690
changed.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.670
And this is the new MAC address.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.250
Now the MAC address as we said it's physical.

05:08.250 --> 05:12.860
It never changes show so it should always be the same but it's going to trust it here.

05:12.870 --> 05:18.450
It's not going to even think about anything as long as I send a response because ARPU trusts everything

05:18.480 --> 05:24.550
it's going to trust the response that I sent.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.210
Now the next step we're going to do.

05:26.210 --> 05:31.310
We're going to send another response to the router this time telling the router that I am the target

05:31.310 --> 05:32.240
device.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.340
So the router whenever it needs to send something to this device it's actually going to send it to me

05:37.600 --> 05:43.310
instead of sending it to that device again because it accepts responses and because it doesn't verify

05:43.580 --> 05:49.880
what information is there it's going to accept that and it's going to treat me as this device.

05:50.850 --> 05:55.390
Now once we do this twice we've actually redirected the flow of packets.

05:55.410 --> 06:00.240
So every time this device wants to do something it's going to think that I am the router.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.470
So it's going to send the request to me.

06:02.610 --> 06:06.380
Well I'm going to do I'm actually going to send the request to the router.

06:06.540 --> 06:12.110
The router is going to go get me the request send it back to me because it thinks that I am this device

06:12.420 --> 06:18.180
and then I'm going to forward that request to the target device.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.940
So as you can see it's actually very simple.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.230
Two main issues with the protocol allow us to exploit our protocol and redirect the flow packets which

06:29.440 --> 06:34.140
causes us becoming the man in the middle and ones who are are the man in the middle.

06:34.140 --> 06:40.000
We can actually do all the attacks that we saw before and we'll see how we can do them in a different

06:40.000 --> 06:40.180
way.

06:40.180 --> 06:41.860
Now in the next lectures.
