00:01.190 --> 00:08.500
Now we're going to talk about how you can protect yourself against poisoning attacks if we go back to

00:08.530 --> 00:10.440
how they are proposing a works.

00:10.450 --> 00:13.280
And we just have a look on them.

00:13.440 --> 00:21.310
If you remember the way they work is by exploiting two major security flaws and they are few protocols.

00:21.370 --> 00:26.520
So the first one is that each day our fuel costs our response is trusted.

00:26.730 --> 00:32.530
The second one was is that their clients accept responses even if they did not ask for it.

00:34.870 --> 00:40.360
So when I go to the router and I tell when I got to the client and I tell him I am the router and he's

00:40.360 --> 00:45.010
going to believe me straight away and when I go to the router and tell him I am the client he's going

00:45.010 --> 00:46.510
to believe me again.

00:46.570 --> 00:50.080
Now the way I tell the router and the client that I'm a different person.

00:50.080 --> 00:58.270
So the way I spoof my identity is by I tell that the target device have a different MAC address.

00:58.270 --> 01:04.420
So when I want to tell the router that I am the client I tell him the person with the client IP has

01:04.420 --> 01:05.740
my MAC address.

01:05.800 --> 01:15.280
So as the AARP table that the router has the MAC address of the client is going to change to one.

01:15.520 --> 01:23.600
And when I do it to the client so I'm going to tell the client the MAC address of the router is my MAC

01:23.600 --> 01:24.360
address.

01:24.560 --> 01:31.730
So the MAC address for the router at the client RPE table is going to change.

01:31.780 --> 01:40.290
So the first way to detect a are people using a tax is only by looking at your ARPU tables.

01:40.300 --> 01:46.720
So if I go here to my target device and I go to a RPA and we saw this in the first month in the middle

01:46.720 --> 01:52.400
with young we're talking about ARPU poisoning we can see the MAC address for the router.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.540
So answer with one if you want to.

01:54.790 --> 01:59.130
Now when I do my AARP attack subs are going to do a simple ARPU poison.

01:59.470 --> 02:04.620
Same way that we always do it is going to turn.

02:04.860 --> 02:14.360
And if I go back to the time machine and I go RPA as you can see here I have the MAC address for the

02:14.360 --> 02:20.960
target device for the target for the router has changed so still the router has this IP but his MAC

02:20.960 --> 02:23.630
address is actually now the attackers Michaela.

02:23.630 --> 02:33.270
So this is if I go to the Ground Zero you'll see that this is the same address that shown up here as

02:33.270 --> 02:34.560
the routers MAC address.

02:34.730 --> 02:42.650
The router is actually my address is this so this is an easy way of detecting what they are proposing

02:42.990 --> 02:45.270
is happening when you're you're being poisoned.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.480
Another way so this is this is very handy and very simple.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.300
But you won't be able to be doing this all the time to check if you're being poisoned or not.

02:54.300 --> 02:59.860
So an easier way is to use a tool that was actually my 30 or AARP tables.

02:59.970 --> 03:06.500
And whenever something happens whenever something such suspicious happens it's going to give me a warning.

03:06.610 --> 03:08.140
So I'm just going to make sure everything is back here.

03:08.160 --> 03:14.420
So when I stop the attack you can see the MAC address is back to the normal MAC address.

03:14.590 --> 03:18.880
So we're going to have an honor to get to have a look on a tool called X HRP.

03:19.030 --> 03:24.990
Now this tool works on Linux on Windows and as you can see you just run the tool.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.380
And even if I close it here.

03:27.490 --> 03:32.920
So this is a basic security to go undetected and get close it's still it's going to run in the background

03:32.920 --> 03:39.990
here and I'm going to go back to Cali and I'm going to do another ARPU poison.

03:40.020 --> 03:45.700
Now this is we can only see one group here so I'm just going to quit it and do it again.

03:45.900 --> 03:51.860
As you can see the two groups and now I have my two groups.

03:51.910 --> 03:53.190
I'll go here.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.030
As you can see we have another

03:58.890 --> 04:06.870
and they alerted us that the MAC address of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 which is the router has changed to something

04:06.870 --> 04:07.370
else.

04:08.460 --> 04:14.700
Now we can also from here we can see that the device that has this MAC address or the device that the

04:14.700 --> 04:17.240
MAC address of there are has been changed to.

04:17.340 --> 04:21.710
Is it connected devices and other device with me on the network and it has this IP.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.410
So now we actually know this is the attacker because this device is Mac.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.630
And the author's apparent MAC address.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.100
This is a spoofed MAC address are the same.

04:31.230 --> 04:39.150
So now we actually know that 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 11 is the person who is trying to do a R.P. poisoning on

04:39.180 --> 04:39.970
our network.

04:43.050 --> 04:49.050
Now these methods only work on your own device so if another device is being they are people isn't so

04:49.050 --> 04:52.130
if there is another device on my network it's been poison.

04:52.200 --> 04:58.290
I want to be able to detect it this way because this only monitors my own HRP table that doesn't it

04:58.290 --> 05:01.680
doesn't have any access to anyone else's HRP table.
