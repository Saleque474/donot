1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,050
An other way to discover people and they get tax and other suspicious behavior and the network is to

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,050
use wireshark.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,910
So let's first of all find Wireshark.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,920
I'm going to enable one feature here if I go on settings

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:30,380
protocols HRP and detect RPE requests so I'm going to think that that's basically going to detect whenever

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,250
a device tries to discover all connected devices.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,340
So whether the attacker is using wireshark or net discover or auto scan whenever a device tries to detect

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,520
all connected devices wash outskirt be able to detect that.

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,880
That's because this device is going is going to try to go through each eyepiece so it's going to go

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,950
on 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 and it's going to send packets asking if that if there is a device exists

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,370
on these IPs.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,320
So we're going to go on our Wi-Fi card and I'm not going to do what they are proposing.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,630
Now I'm just going around net discover.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,650
So just like right before we're going to use our wireless card and then I'm going to put my rage

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,070
over 24 and that's it it's finished.

16
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,610
I discovered everything.

17
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,250
Now if we go back we actually don't even need something to tell us or give us a warning as we can see

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,460
here that it's asking for who has we can see that the MAC address of the target the source is the MAC

19
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,150
address of our attacker machine and it's asking about each single IP so I was asking about 33 to 33

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,740
34 something from one like ants going all the way up and asking if there is a device on this IP.

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:57,340
Now if you go and analyze and we go on the ex-parte tempo if we go on the notes you'll see that we have

22
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:04,750
our peers packet's term have been detected which is basically some devices trying to detect all connected

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,620
devices.

24
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,140
Let's go back here and we're going to do and they are people isn't normal they are poisoned like we

25
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,830
always do it going to enter and the devices were entirely correctly so I'm just going to do it again.

26
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,770
And the groups are OK now so we'll go back to here.

27
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:39,040
So if we go on analyze the expert info you'll see that we have another warning here and that's a double

28
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:47,540
digit IP address for 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 which means that the router appears to have two Mica addresses

29
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,690
and this can never happen because each device should have 1 1 MAC address.

30
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:59,840
So we know that someone is trying to poison us here again.

31
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:07,040
So that's the three methods that would help us detect they are poisoning attacks.

32
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,350
Now if we go let me just go here and I'm going to go and run

33
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:22,410
and RPA This is my RPE table so as you can see that these entries are dynamic.

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,360
That means that they can change and they're allowed to be changed.

35
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:35,240
So one way of completely protecting your network against our people is allowing attacks is to use static

36
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,140
IP tables and static IP tables.

37
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,910
And trees are not allowed to be changed so once you actually put on and configure the market was for

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,290
the router for example.

39
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,420
That can never be changed.

40
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:55,020
Therefore when someone tries to poison your device and spoof the MAC address of the router.

41
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,240
This is not going to work because you have a static table that its value can never be changed.

42
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,130
The only problem with using static IP tables is that you're going to have to configure the AARP tables

43
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,620
in each device every time there's a new device connects to the network because because they're static

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,930
they're not going to be accept any changes to them.

45
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,220
Therefore you're going to have to manually configure each one of them whenever there's a new device

46
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,780
to connect network.

47
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,580
But it's a solution to completely protect yourself or your network against it.

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,070
It's hard to implement and large that works well on smaller networks.

49
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,580
It's as can be implemented it can be done and it completely completely protect you against people visiting

50
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,070
attacks.
