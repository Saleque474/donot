1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:08,500
Now we're going to talk about how you can protect yourself against poisoning attacks if we go back to

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,440
how they are proposing a works.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,280
And we just have a look on them.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,310
If you remember the way they work is by exploiting two major security flaws and they are few protocols.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,520
So the first one is that each day our fuel costs our response is trusted.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,530
The second one was is that their clients accept responses even if they did not ask for it.

7
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,360
So when I go to the router and I tell when I got to the client and I tell him I am the router and he's

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,010
going to believe me straight away and when I go to the router and tell him I am the client he's going

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,510
to believe me again.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,080
Now the way I tell the router and the client that I'm a different person.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,270
So the way I spoof my identity is by I tell that the target device have a different MAC address.

12
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,420
So when I want to tell the router that I am the client I tell him the person with the client IP has

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,740
my MAC address.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:15,280
So as the AARP table that the router has the MAC address of the client is going to change to one.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,600
And when I do it to the client so I'm going to tell the client the MAC address of the router is my MAC

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,360
address.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,730
So the MAC address for the router at the client RPE table is going to change.

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:40,290
So the first way to detect a are people using a tax is only by looking at your ARPU tables.

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,720
So if I go here to my target device and I go to a RPA and we saw this in the first month in the middle

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,400
with young we're talking about ARPU poisoning we can see the MAC address for the router.

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,540
So answer with one if you want to.

22
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,130
Now when I do my AARP attack subs are going to do a simple ARPU poison.

23
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,620
Same way that we always do it is going to turn.

24
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:14,360
And if I go back to the time machine and I go RPA as you can see here I have the MAC address for the

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,960
target device for the target for the router has changed so still the router has this IP but his MAC

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,630
address is actually now the attackers Michaela.

27
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:33,270
So this is if I go to the Ground Zero you'll see that this is the same address that shown up here as

28
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,560
the routers MAC address.

29
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:42,650
The router is actually my address is this so this is an easy way of detecting what they are proposing

30
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,270
is happening when you're you're being poisoned.

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Another way so this is this is very handy and very simple.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,300
But you won't be able to be doing this all the time to check if you're being poisoned or not.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,860
So an easier way is to use a tool that was actually my 30 or AARP tables.

34
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,500
And whenever something happens whenever something such suspicious happens it's going to give me a warning.

35
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,140
So I'm just going to make sure everything is back here.

36
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,420
So when I stop the attack you can see the MAC address is back to the normal MAC address.

37
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,880
So we're going to have an honor to get to have a look on a tool called X HRP.

38
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,990
Now this tool works on Linux on Windows and as you can see you just run the tool.

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,380
And even if I close it here.

40
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,920
So this is a basic security to go undetected and get close it's still it's going to run in the background

41
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,990
here and I'm going to go back to Cali and I'm going to do another ARPU poison.

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,700
Now this is we can only see one group here so I'm just going to quit it and do it again.

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,860
As you can see the two groups and now I have my two groups.

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,190
I'll go here.

45
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,030
As you can see we have another

46
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:06,870
and they alerted us that the MAC address of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 which is the router has changed to something

47
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,370
else.

48
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,700
Now we can also from here we can see that the device that has this MAC address or the device that the

49
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,240
MAC address of there are has been changed to.

50
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,710
Is it connected devices and other device with me on the network and it has this IP.

51
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,410
So now we actually know this is the attacker because this device is Mac.

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,630
And the author's apparent MAC address.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,100
This is a spoofed MAC address are the same.

54
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:39,150
So now we actually know that 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 11 is the person who is trying to do a R.P. poisoning on

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,970
our network.

56
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,050
Now these methods only work on your own device so if another device is being they are people isn't so

57
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,130
if there is another device on my network it's been poison.

58
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,290
I want to be able to detect it this way because this only monitors my own HRP table that doesn't it

59
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,680
doesn't have any access to anyone else's HRP table.
