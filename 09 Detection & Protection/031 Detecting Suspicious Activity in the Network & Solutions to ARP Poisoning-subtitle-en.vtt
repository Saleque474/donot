00:01.360 --> 00:07.050
An other way to discover people and they get tax and other suspicious behavior and the network is to

00:07.050 --> 00:09.050
use wireshark.

00:09.080 --> 00:13.910
So let's first of all find Wireshark.

00:13.940 --> 00:17.920
I'm going to enable one feature here if I go on settings

00:21.020 --> 00:30.380
protocols HRP and detect RPE requests so I'm going to think that that's basically going to detect whenever

00:30.380 --> 00:34.250
a device tries to discover all connected devices.

00:34.280 --> 00:40.340
So whether the attacker is using wireshark or net discover or auto scan whenever a device tries to detect

00:40.370 --> 00:44.520
all connected devices wash outskirt be able to detect that.

00:44.570 --> 00:49.880
That's because this device is going is going to try to go through each eyepiece so it's going to go

00:49.880 --> 00:57.950
on 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 and it's going to send packets asking if that if there is a device exists

00:58.220 --> 00:59.370
on these IPs.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.320
So we're going to go on our Wi-Fi card and I'm not going to do what they are proposing.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.630
Now I'm just going around net discover.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.650
So just like right before we're going to use our wireless card and then I'm going to put my rage

01:18.380 --> 01:22.070
over 24 and that's it it's finished.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.610
I discovered everything.

01:23.610 --> 01:29.250
Now if we go back we actually don't even need something to tell us or give us a warning as we can see

01:29.250 --> 01:35.460
here that it's asking for who has we can see that the MAC address of the target the source is the MAC

01:35.460 --> 01:42.150
address of our attacker machine and it's asking about each single IP so I was asking about 33 to 33

01:42.150 --> 01:49.740
34 something from one like ants going all the way up and asking if there is a device on this IP.

01:49.740 --> 01:57.340
Now if you go and analyze and we go on the ex-parte tempo if we go on the notes you'll see that we have

01:58.540 --> 02:04.750
our peers packet's term have been detected which is basically some devices trying to detect all connected

02:04.750 --> 02:06.620
devices.

02:06.630 --> 02:13.140
Let's go back here and we're going to do and they are people isn't normal they are poisoned like we

02:13.140 --> 02:20.830
always do it going to enter and the devices were entirely correctly so I'm just going to do it again.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.770
And the groups are OK now so we'll go back to here.

02:30.860 --> 02:39.040
So if we go on analyze the expert info you'll see that we have another warning here and that's a double

02:39.050 --> 02:47.540
digit IP address for 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 which means that the router appears to have two Mica addresses

02:47.900 --> 02:51.690
and this can never happen because each device should have 1 1 MAC address.

02:51.830 --> 02:59.840
So we know that someone is trying to poison us here again.

03:00.170 --> 03:07.040
So that's the three methods that would help us detect they are poisoning attacks.

03:07.050 --> 03:10.350
Now if we go let me just go here and I'm going to go and run

03:13.100 --> 03:22.410
and RPA This is my RPE table so as you can see that these entries are dynamic.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.360
That means that they can change and they're allowed to be changed.

03:27.590 --> 03:35.240
So one way of completely protecting your network against our people is allowing attacks is to use static

03:35.270 --> 03:38.140
IP tables and static IP tables.

03:38.140 --> 03:43.910
And trees are not allowed to be changed so once you actually put on and configure the market was for

03:43.900 --> 03:45.290
the router for example.

03:45.380 --> 03:47.420
That can never be changed.

03:47.480 --> 03:55.020
Therefore when someone tries to poison your device and spoof the MAC address of the router.

03:55.370 --> 04:01.240
This is not going to work because you have a static table that its value can never be changed.

04:01.250 --> 04:07.130
The only problem with using static IP tables is that you're going to have to configure the AARP tables

04:07.130 --> 04:13.620
in each device every time there's a new device connects to the network because because they're static

04:13.620 --> 04:15.930
they're not going to be accept any changes to them.

04:15.930 --> 04:20.220
Therefore you're going to have to manually configure each one of them whenever there's a new device

04:20.220 --> 04:21.780
to connect network.

04:22.270 --> 04:27.580
But it's a solution to completely protect yourself or your network against it.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.070
It's hard to implement and large that works well on smaller networks.

04:31.080 --> 04:37.580
It's as can be implemented it can be done and it completely completely protect you against people visiting

04:37.590 --> 04:38.070
attacks.
