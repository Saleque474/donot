1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,070
So now we're going to see how we're going to use a script that will download any files from a certain

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,890
you or L and execute that file.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,710
Why do I like this script now.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,940
This is because it's actually a really really simple script it's only two lines well two lines to be

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,180
executed taking because you can create any you can download any files so you can create any file you

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,900
use in any Fromer that you want.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,570
You can create any backdoor any kind of factor that you like you can use a virus you can use trojan

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,950
or you can use a key logger you can just use a normal.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,020
You can basically use any file that you want and then you will execute that file.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,070
And if you don't you can just remove the line that executes the file and then you can just get it to

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,310
download the file to the target machine.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,700
So this will happen simply by connecting your Android device to the target machine using you speed.

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,700
You will download a certain file and execute it.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,870
So first of all let's see what is the script I'm going to be using that will do that.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,170
So the first line is just a delay so it's going to wait for two seconds before it does anything.

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,680
Then the second line right here is going to show the Run box.

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,200
The third line is the DNA of a 100 milliseconds just to wait until the ront box shows up.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,900
Once we have the run we're going to type in a power shell command which will basically download a file

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,890
that is stored on this you're out.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:43,910
So this is just an IP address of a of a machine that's running a web server on my network.

21
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,140
So this can be anywhere else where your file is stored.

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,710
So I basically have a file called not be on this candy machine right here.

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:02:04,640
So this candy machine if I go to my bar would be WW I have a file called that we see which is basically

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,860
just a backdoor created using Val evasion as we saw in the previous video.

25
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,740
So I just have that file.

26
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,500
There's nothing special about it just the back door.

27
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,570
It's stored and this is the IP address of that machine and it's the file is called not Windows XP.

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,250
So it's going to download this file is going to rename it to be the ATX either.

29
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,820
So you can replace this with anywhere else that you want and has to be a direct download.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,500
You are.

31
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,560
For where your file is stored.

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,110
So it's going to rename it to redirect the XP then it's going to wait for half a second.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,670
It's going to execute the Run box again.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,460
It's going to wait for 100 milliseconds and then it's going to run this.

35
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,500
So if you don't want to run it you can just remove this last line right here and it's just not going

36
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,590
to run it.

37
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,640
And if you want to change the name where it's stored you can change it here.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,250
So for example if you're downloading something does not need you for example if it was a zip then you

39
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,210
just typed dot zip here.

40
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:15,410
So you're going to have to change the R L for where you are going to save your ex or your file to be

41
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,740
downloaded and you would change this if you want.

42
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,060
This will just run the file.

43
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,300
So if you don't want the file to be Iran you wouldn't change this and make sure that we got the axes

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,880
the same here.

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
So if you rename it here you have to rename it.

46
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,110
So that's the file I'm going to use be using.

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,800
And I've already copied it.

48
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:47,660
So I'm just going to go back to my kind of menu I'm going to go to my page ID the script tag and you

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,250
just paste your file here so your paste the rubber duckies script right here.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,050
And then you can click on convert.

51
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,360
So I'm going to click on updates already updated.

52
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,280
Then I'm going to click on convert and that will basically convert it to Haiti.

53
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,920
Id a keyboard attack format so you can see in the preview here that's what how what it looks like when

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,310
it's converted.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,930
And I'm just going to go back to my Kaleem and you and I have my listeners here already like as I showed

56
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,120
you in my previous video so I'm just going to do an exploit on it.

57
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,360
And now I was listening.

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,710
So I'm going to come here.

59
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,970
I'm basically just going to type on these three little dots and execute the attack.

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,050
And we go to our windows.

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,420
And as you can see now the attack is actually the command is being written automatically.

62
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,850
So I'm not writing anything.

63
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,340
And that's what I like about it's only two commands.

64
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,880
This this is the first command to download the file and then the second command to run it.

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,860
And that's it.

66
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,420
We have them there for their show right here.

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,660
So that's why it's really cool that's why I like doing this particular script because it's weather like

68
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,390
there are scripts that will basically give you a reverse show but they need to run more commands.

69
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,780
With this it's actually just really quick to commands and the speed of the command being tied depends

70
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,680
on your processor.

71
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,190
Now my I'm using the 2012 Nexus 7 so it's a bit slow and I have a lot of things running on it in order

72
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,220
to mirror the image and all that.

73
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,090
So for you it might be a lot quicker than what happened to me.

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,950
There's one more thing that I want to show you.

75
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,740
And that is already made payloads that you can use with the rubber ducky I didn't I didn't show you

76
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,860
in the previous video so I'm not going to put all this in the resources so I'm just going to show you

77
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,900
here of the payloads that you can get.

78
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,530
So that's all the payload that you can get.

79
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,490
So there's a lot of payloads I can give you you can get a basic terminal command and you want to add

80
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,120
there is always x payload.

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,720
There are payloads to allow you to download stuff those Speedos to allow you to upload stuff.

82
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:14,120
All you have to do is click on the payload right click it copied and pasted in taunter convert and execute.

83
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,480
Same way I just did that.

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,630
And the payload I just used I'm going to put it in resources for you to download and to use and test

85
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,690
it on your own machines.
