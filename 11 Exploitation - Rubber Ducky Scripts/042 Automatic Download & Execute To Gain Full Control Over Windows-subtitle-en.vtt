WEBVTT

00:04.320 --> 00:11.070
So now we're going to see how we're going to use a script that will download any files from a certain

00:11.070 --> 00:13.890
you or L and execute that file.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.710
Why do I like this script now.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.940
This is because it's actually a really really simple script it's only two lines well two lines to be

00:20.940 --> 00:27.180
executed taking because you can create any you can download any files so you can create any file you

00:27.180 --> 00:28.900
use in any Fromer that you want.

00:29.040 --> 00:35.570
You can create any backdoor any kind of factor that you like you can use a virus you can use trojan

00:35.580 --> 00:39.950
or you can use a key logger you can just use a normal.

00:40.020 --> 00:45.020
You can basically use any file that you want and then you will execute that file.

00:45.020 --> 00:50.070
And if you don't you can just remove the line that executes the file and then you can just get it to

00:50.070 --> 00:52.310
download the file to the target machine.

00:52.380 --> 00:57.700
So this will happen simply by connecting your Android device to the target machine using you speed.

00:57.810 --> 01:01.700
You will download a certain file and execute it.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.870
So first of all let's see what is the script I'm going to be using that will do that.

01:08.160 --> 01:14.170
So the first line is just a delay so it's going to wait for two seconds before it does anything.

01:14.190 --> 01:19.680
Then the second line right here is going to show the Run box.

01:19.740 --> 01:26.200
The third line is the DNA of a 100 milliseconds just to wait until the ront box shows up.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.900
Once we have the run we're going to type in a power shell command which will basically download a file

01:32.900 --> 01:34.890
that is stored on this you're out.

01:35.120 --> 01:43.910
So this is just an IP address of a of a machine that's running a web server on my network.

01:44.060 --> 01:47.140
So this can be anywhere else where your file is stored.

01:47.140 --> 01:52.710
So I basically have a file called not be on this candy machine right here.

01:52.790 --> 02:04.640
So this candy machine if I go to my bar would be WW I have a file called that we see which is basically

02:04.640 --> 02:09.860
just a backdoor created using Val evasion as we saw in the previous video.

02:10.190 --> 02:11.740
So I just have that file.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.500
There's nothing special about it just the back door.

02:15.690 --> 02:22.570
It's stored and this is the IP address of that machine and it's the file is called not Windows XP.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.250
So it's going to download this file is going to rename it to be the ATX either.

02:27.410 --> 02:32.820
So you can replace this with anywhere else that you want and has to be a direct download.

02:32.870 --> 02:33.500
You are.

02:33.770 --> 02:37.560
For where your file is stored.

02:37.740 --> 02:44.110
So it's going to rename it to redirect the XP then it's going to wait for half a second.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.670
It's going to execute the Run box again.

02:47.750 --> 02:52.460
It's going to wait for 100 milliseconds and then it's going to run this.

02:52.460 --> 02:57.500
So if you don't want to run it you can just remove this last line right here and it's just not going

02:57.500 --> 02:58.590
to run it.

02:58.580 --> 03:01.640
And if you want to change the name where it's stored you can change it here.

03:01.640 --> 03:07.250
So for example if you're downloading something does not need you for example if it was a zip then you

03:07.250 --> 03:09.210
just typed dot zip here.

03:09.350 --> 03:15.410
So you're going to have to change the R L for where you are going to save your ex or your file to be

03:15.410 --> 03:19.740
downloaded and you would change this if you want.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.060
This will just run the file.

03:21.060 --> 03:26.300
So if you don't want the file to be Iran you wouldn't change this and make sure that we got the axes

03:26.310 --> 03:26.880
the same here.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.880
So if you rename it here you have to rename it.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.110
So that's the file I'm going to use be using.

03:33.150 --> 03:34.800
And I've already copied it.

03:35.310 --> 03:47.660
So I'm just going to go back to my kind of menu I'm going to go to my page ID the script tag and you

03:47.660 --> 03:52.250
just paste your file here so your paste the rubber duckies script right here.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.050
And then you can click on convert.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.360
So I'm going to click on updates already updated.

04:00.690 --> 04:06.280
Then I'm going to click on convert and that will basically convert it to Haiti.

04:06.300 --> 04:11.920
Id a keyboard attack format so you can see in the preview here that's what how what it looks like when

04:11.920 --> 04:13.310
it's converted.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.930
And I'm just going to go back to my Kaleem and you and I have my listeners here already like as I showed

04:18.930 --> 04:22.120
you in my previous video so I'm just going to do an exploit on it.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.360
And now I was listening.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.710
So I'm going to come here.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.970
I'm basically just going to type on these three little dots and execute the attack.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.050
And we go to our windows.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.420
And as you can see now the attack is actually the command is being written automatically.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.850
So I'm not writing anything.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.340
And that's what I like about it's only two commands.

04:43.340 --> 04:47.880
This this is the first command to download the file and then the second command to run it.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.860
And that's it.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.420
We have them there for their show right here.

04:52.480 --> 04:58.660
So that's why it's really cool that's why I like doing this particular script because it's weather like

04:58.660 --> 05:03.390
there are scripts that will basically give you a reverse show but they need to run more commands.

05:03.510 --> 05:10.780
With this it's actually just really quick to commands and the speed of the command being tied depends

05:10.780 --> 05:11.680
on your processor.

05:11.680 --> 05:18.190
Now my I'm using the 2012 Nexus 7 so it's a bit slow and I have a lot of things running on it in order

05:18.190 --> 05:20.220
to mirror the image and all that.

05:20.230 --> 05:24.090
So for you it might be a lot quicker than what happened to me.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.950
There's one more thing that I want to show you.

05:27.730 --> 05:32.740
And that is already made payloads that you can use with the rubber ducky I didn't I didn't show you

05:32.740 --> 05:38.860
in the previous video so I'm not going to put all this in the resources so I'm just going to show you

05:38.860 --> 05:40.900
here of the payloads that you can get.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.530
So that's all the payload that you can get.

05:51.540 --> 05:57.490
So there's a lot of payloads I can give you you can get a basic terminal command and you want to add

05:57.520 --> 06:00.120
there is always x payload.

06:00.140 --> 06:04.720
There are payloads to allow you to download stuff those Speedos to allow you to upload stuff.

06:04.910 --> 06:14.120
All you have to do is click on the payload right click it copied and pasted in taunter convert and execute.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.480
Same way I just did that.

06:16.310 --> 06:21.630
And the payload I just used I'm going to put it in resources for you to download and to use and test

06:21.630 --> 06:22.690
it on your own machines.
