00:03.840 --> 00:12.340
So as I said before the keyboard that works on all operating systems including Windows OS X and Linux.

00:12.420 --> 00:20.360
So by plug in our Android device to an OS X system we can still fool that system that our Android device

00:20.360 --> 00:26.570
is a keyboard and we can still send keystrokes to the system as if we are a keyboard.

00:26.670 --> 00:34.830
So and this video will see how we can use the ID rubber ducky script attacks to create a script that

00:34.830 --> 00:43.110
will use OS X shell and try to connect back to my Android device which will give me full access to that

00:43.170 --> 00:45.260
operating system or to that device.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.830
So basically what we're going to do is we're going to launch terminal.

00:50.990 --> 00:59.670
We're going to run a command to connect to a certain IP and this IP can be any device so it can be Linux.

00:59.670 --> 01:03.970
Another Linux device it can be a Windows device it can be your next punter.

01:03.970 --> 01:07.680
All you need is a tool called netcat to listen on a port.

01:07.690 --> 01:13.810
So before we saw when we were using Mutazz ploys payloads we were using we just ploy to listen for incoming

01:13.810 --> 01:16.070
connections.

01:16.090 --> 01:23.170
Today we're only using a normal connection and normal TCAP connection from us X to another IP.

01:23.170 --> 01:30.190
So you just need a simple to call that Guert which is available on all operating systems and it's preinstalled

01:30.190 --> 01:33.300
on your net punter and on normal Kalli for PCs.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.610
So you can straightaway just run the command and it's going to work.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.740
So let me first show you what the script is like.

01:42.740 --> 01:47.640
It's actually a really really simple.

01:47.830 --> 01:53.950
So I have it here downloaded and I'm going to obviously include it's for you and the resources.

01:53.950 --> 01:55.350
So this is all those.

01:55.340 --> 01:59.560
First of all it does a delay for 1000 and waits for one second.

01:59.860 --> 02:07.030
Then it says Type seen GeoEye and space which basically shows the spotlight for OS X operating system.

02:07.030 --> 02:12.850
So if I type in cmd and space I get my Spotlight search which allows me to run any program just like

02:12.850 --> 02:17.290
when you type in the CND or when you type in the Windows key on Windows machines

02:19.930 --> 02:24.690
then it's going to type in terminal to show the terminal.

02:24.820 --> 02:27.940
Then it's going to wait for 500 for half a second.

02:28.210 --> 02:32.950
Then it's going to type and enter so that will start the terminal for me.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.320
Once it starts the terminal it's going to run this command.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.700
So this is the command that will do the connection.

02:38.780 --> 02:43.190
So all you need to do is modify this part.

02:43.190 --> 02:48.730
This IP address and put the IP address for the device which will receive the connection.

02:48.770 --> 02:55.250
So this should be the device is the same thing when we were using L host so it should be the IP of the

02:55.250 --> 02:58.730
device that will run netcat on it.

03:00.100 --> 03:04.300
And this video I'm not going to be using my Linux some previous videos I was actually use in my Linux

03:04.690 --> 03:05.390
to or.

03:05.450 --> 03:11.240
But today I'm going to run this on or not around that out just to receive the connections.

03:11.420 --> 03:15.940
Today I'm going to do it on my calendar on turtles and that's cuds really simple there's no point of

03:15.950 --> 03:18.630
having two operating systems running on the same time.

03:18.650 --> 03:26.220
So I'm just going to go on my terminal and start netcat which will wait for the connection then we can

03:26.220 --> 03:29.240
execute this attack before I execute this attack.

03:29.240 --> 03:35.190
Though I want to modify this and put my IP address because this IP is wrong so I'm going to just go

03:35.190 --> 03:38.690
see what is my IP address.

03:38.780 --> 03:41.500
You can do that in my home right here.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.610
So you can see that my IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 117.

03:45.800 --> 03:52.380
Again you can't put any IP address in here as long as you're going to listen on netcat on that IP address.

03:53.790 --> 04:01.410
So one towards the end and the final part of this command actually here this is the port.

04:01.540 --> 04:04.210
So we're connecting on 4 4 4 4 4.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.040
You can't change that.

04:05.070 --> 04:09.030
Any ports you want to listen to and you want to receive the connection too.

04:09.160 --> 04:14.320
So I'm going to copy all this.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.250
I'm going to go on my rubber ducky

04:19.510 --> 04:20.860
I'm going to paste my code

04:25.320 --> 04:33.830
I'm going to have updates and I'm going to do a convert so I can actually launch the attacks right away.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.140
But before I do that as I said I need to listen on port 4 4 4 4.

04:38.410 --> 04:47.160
So I'm going to go and launch my terminal and I'm going to listen on the fourth Usenet Kathe using the

04:47.160 --> 04:48.380
following command.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.850
And after you put the forth.

04:54.860 --> 05:02.530
So for for's we're going to hit enter and now says that it's listening on 4 4 4 4 4.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.340
So that's perfect.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.070
So I'm going to go back now to my you know taunter menu

05:11.860 --> 05:19.970
and I'm going to go on my rubber ducky and I'm going to hit on the three little buds and execute a tag

05:21.810 --> 05:24.280
as you can see now it's typing in the command.

05:24.290 --> 05:27.600
Why it's so.

05:27.730 --> 05:37.730
Now if I go back so they can show you here and I'm going to go back to my terminal as you can see now

05:37.740 --> 05:44.940
I got abash command prompt and this is on my sex machine and to verify this I'm just going to give you

05:44.940 --> 05:48.400
a PWT and you can see it's in users zoos.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.370
And if I do a you uname

05:53.150 --> 05:57.940
a which will basically just show the kernel information and device information.

05:57.970 --> 06:01.750
Can see that it is its MacBook Pro.

06:01.890 --> 06:03.540
You can see the kernel version and all that.

06:03.540 --> 06:09.470
And basically this is full access to the device so you can run all UNIX commands on my.

06:09.540 --> 06:14.970
So now basically have full access on my MacBook Pro and you can run any Unix command that you want to

06:14.970 --> 06:22.720
do so you can do an ls Toolis files you can navigate so you can go and see the test or you can do anywhere.

06:22.880 --> 06:29.850
Or basically go anywhere you want download upload run other commands and store stuff out services basically

06:29.850 --> 06:32.180
full access to the machine you have now.
