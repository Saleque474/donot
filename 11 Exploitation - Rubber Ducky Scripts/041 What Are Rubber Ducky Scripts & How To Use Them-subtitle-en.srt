00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,170
We saw previously how we can connect our Android device to our target computer and have a tool that

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,220
computer that my device is a keyboard then execute certain commands to the username and password then

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,820
connect using Remote Desktop.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,600
Then we show the power supply option where we actually inject and we test ploys payload and then have

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,060
a reverse interpretor connection which allows us to do a lot of cool stuff on the target machine basically

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,450
gives us full access to the target machine.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,700
Today we're going to have a look on another flavor of the A.H. ID keyboard attack.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,570
And this is the Dulcie's.

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,160
First of all the rubber ducky is a USP device that you connect to a computer and when you connect it

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,360
it runs certain commands exactly the same way that we do it when we connect our Android device.

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,550
So it's very similar to the idea keyboard attack.

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,880
The difference is there are a lot of DocI scripts out there that are already made.

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,930
So you can copy and paste them and use them straight away.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,100
And also you can write your own Docky scripts.

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:18,810
So I'm going to put links for the payload generators for already existing payloads and for resources

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,940
on teaching you how to write your own Docky scripts on the resources.

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,530
It's actually really simple writing scripts right.

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,970
We're going to have a look on them and the next video so you can use existing Dulcie's scripts.

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,060
Or you can write your own Dulcie's script or you can use the payload generator.

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,570
So let me show you here.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,290
So that's the script Web site.

22
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,700
The script tool kit so you can use the payload generator here on our Web site Alibhai going on create

23
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:55,030
payload and then you can just basically take what you want to do so you can do information gathering

24
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:03,250
here such as doing a port scan just computer information user information use the information all that

25
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,640
kind of stuff.

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:12,540
And here you can either use or you can enable the remote desktop you can delete the windows updates

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,580
you can get a reverse shell here create a reverse show so you can do all that stuff but we've already

28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,390
done this we've already made a user and added it to the user who's in Cali and we already made the power

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,010
supply and got reverse connection.

30
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,000
So all the cool stuff in the payload We've actually already done them.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,970
So I'm not going to do that I'm going to do something now.

32
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,960
And the next video you can also go on the help here.

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:50,040
And then we can go onto the syntax guide and that will basically show you how you can write the scripts.

34
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:57,280
So for example if you right you are then that means it's going to show you the windows run box where

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,940
you can run ACMD or put something.

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,310
So for example here it's poisonous ring TMD and it's running CMG and then they're going to get the command

37
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,590
prompt and then you could run.

38
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,050
Come on.

39
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,700
Come on from.

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,250
So it's exactly like the keyboards.

41
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,290
Thank you.

42
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,280
Your device will be pretending that it is a keyboard but you have more flexibility and you have more

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,300
options more things that you can do.

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,550
Also the keyboard that works on Linux and OSS systems and we saw that the net Hunter doesn't give us

45
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,300
autem doesn't allow us to do a lot of things automatically with them.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,750
So using the rubber ducky you can actually write your own script for us x or for Linux and just write

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,880
the command that you want to run on the target machine.

48
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,510
So you have here are a few examples and also show you how you can write your own script now and the

49
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,020
next video I'll show you at Download an execute script which allows us to download a certain file and

50
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,690
executed on the target machine simply by connecting our Android device.
