1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,340
So as I said before the keyboard that works on all operating systems including Windows OS X and Linux.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:20,360
So by plug in our Android device to an OS X system we can still fool that system that our Android device

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,570
is a keyboard and we can still send keystrokes to the system as if we are a keyboard.

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,830
So and this video will see how we can use the ID rubber ducky script attacks to create a script that

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:43,110
will use OS X shell and try to connect back to my Android device which will give me full access to that

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,260
operating system or to that device.

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,830
So basically what we're going to do is we're going to launch terminal.

8
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:59,670
We're going to run a command to connect to a certain IP and this IP can be any device so it can be Linux.

9
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,970
Another Linux device it can be a Windows device it can be your next punter.

10
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,680
All you need is a tool called netcat to listen on a port.

11
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,810
So before we saw when we were using Mutazz ploys payloads we were using we just ploy to listen for incoming

12
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,070
connections.

13
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,170
Today we're only using a normal connection and normal TCAP connection from us X to another IP.

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:30,190
So you just need a simple to call that Guert which is available on all operating systems and it's preinstalled

15
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,300
on your net punter and on normal Kalli for PCs.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,610
So you can straightaway just run the command and it's going to work.

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,740
So let me first show you what the script is like.

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,640
It's actually a really really simple.

19
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,950
So I have it here downloaded and I'm going to obviously include it's for you and the resources.

20
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,350
So this is all those.

21
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,560
First of all it does a delay for 1000 and waits for one second.

22
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:07,030
Then it says Type seen GeoEye and space which basically shows the spotlight for OS X operating system.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,850
So if I type in cmd and space I get my Spotlight search which allows me to run any program just like

24
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,290
when you type in the CND or when you type in the Windows key on Windows machines

25
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,690
then it's going to type in terminal to show the terminal.

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,940
Then it's going to wait for 500 for half a second.

27
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,950
Then it's going to type and enter so that will start the terminal for me.

28
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,320
Once it starts the terminal it's going to run this command.

29
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,700
So this is the command that will do the connection.

30
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,190
So all you need to do is modify this part.

31
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,730
This IP address and put the IP address for the device which will receive the connection.

32
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,250
So this should be the device is the same thing when we were using L host so it should be the IP of the

33
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,730
device that will run netcat on it.

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,300
And this video I'm not going to be using my Linux some previous videos I was actually use in my Linux

35
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,390
to or.

36
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,240
But today I'm going to run this on or not around that out just to receive the connections.

37
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,940
Today I'm going to do it on my calendar on turtles and that's cuds really simple there's no point of

38
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,630
having two operating systems running on the same time.

39
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,220
So I'm just going to go on my terminal and start netcat which will wait for the connection then we can

40
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,240
execute this attack before I execute this attack.

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,190
Though I want to modify this and put my IP address because this IP is wrong so I'm going to just go

42
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,690
see what is my IP address.

43
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,500
You can do that in my home right here.

44
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,610
So you can see that my IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 117.

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,380
Again you can't put any IP address in here as long as you're going to listen on netcat on that IP address.

46
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:01,410
So one towards the end and the final part of this command actually here this is the port.

47
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,210
So we're connecting on 4 4 4 4 4.

48
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,040
You can't change that.

49
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,030
Any ports you want to listen to and you want to receive the connection too.

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,320
So I'm going to copy all this.

51
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,250
I'm going to go on my rubber ducky

52
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm going to paste my code

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:33,830
I'm going to have updates and I'm going to do a convert so I can actually launch the attacks right away.

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,140
But before I do that as I said I need to listen on port 4 4 4 4.

55
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:47,160
So I'm going to go and launch my terminal and I'm going to listen on the fourth Usenet Kathe using the

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,380
following command.

57
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,850
And after you put the forth.

58
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,530
So for for's we're going to hit enter and now says that it's listening on 4 4 4 4 4.

59
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,340
So that's perfect.

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,070
So I'm going to go back now to my you know taunter menu

61
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:19,970
and I'm going to go on my rubber ducky and I'm going to hit on the three little buds and execute a tag

62
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,280
as you can see now it's typing in the command.

63
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,600
Why it's so.

64
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:37,730
Now if I go back so they can show you here and I'm going to go back to my terminal as you can see now

65
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,940
I got abash command prompt and this is on my sex machine and to verify this I'm just going to give you

66
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,400
a PWT and you can see it's in users zoos.

67
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,370
And if I do a you uname

68
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,940
a which will basically just show the kernel information and device information.

69
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,750
Can see that it is its MacBook Pro.

70
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,540
You can see the kernel version and all that.

71
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,470
And basically this is full access to the device so you can run all UNIX commands on my.

72
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,970
So now basically have full access on my MacBook Pro and you can run any Unix command that you want to

73
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:22,720
do so you can do an ls Toolis files you can navigate so you can go and see the test or you can do anywhere.

74
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,850
Or basically go anywhere you want download upload run other commands and store stuff out services basically

75
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,180
full access to the machine you have now.
