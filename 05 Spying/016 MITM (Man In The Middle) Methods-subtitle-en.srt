1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,580
So the three main methods that we're going to use to become the man in the middle are the bad USV man

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,770
in the middle attack HRP poisoning and evil access point.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:22,440
So the bad US man in the middle attack will basically allow you to become the man in the middle by connecting

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,750
your Android device to the target's laptop or to the computer.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,880
Once you do that the Android device is going to fool that computer that it is a wireless or that is

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,930
a network card.

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,220
Once it does that it's also going to force all the traffic through the Android device.

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,520
So instead of your laptop for example when you go to Google dotcom it's going to use your wireless card

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,050
or your wild card and use the means of connection whether you're connected via wire or wireless go to

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,470
the router ask for Google.

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,600
Bring it back when you connect your Android device to it.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,040
It's actually going to think the card is your Android device.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,740
So when it wants to go to Google dot com it's going to send it to your to your device then your device

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,520
using 3G or use an another wireless card will go get Google does come and give it back to the computer.

15
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,420
So your device is the man in the middle.

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,720
All the packets will be flowing through your device therefore you can read intercept or modify them.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,430
Again we're going to talk about this in more detail.

18
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,390
And the attacks that you achieve after that you can mix them or you can do them with other man in the

19
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,400
middle attacks.

20
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,550
It doesn't really matter how you become the man in the middle wants or the man in the middle you can

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,400
do these attacks anyway.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,750
The second method is used and they are poisoning.

23
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,310
This is a bit more complicated but it's explained in diagrams.

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,380
And once you actually understand it it's really simple at the start it's hard to get your head around.

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,580
But once you actually go through the lessons it's going to be very simple very powerful very useful

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,110
at that.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,620
This is very powerful and useful because you don't need to physically connect to your Android device.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,950
It literally works because of a flaw in a.

29
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,810
And the AARP protocol.

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,070
So we're going to talk about this and we can understand how this works.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,670
Once you can actually do this you can run it into you can write on Wired and on wireless networks it's

32
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,700
very powerful and works on all operating systems.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,000
So it is very very useful.

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,900
The bad us we attack also works on all operating systems windows and X and Mac and the third method.

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,300
We're going to talk about is the evil access point.

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,750
So in this method we're actually going to create a wireless network.

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,590
So we're going to use our Android device the same way when you do tethering.

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,070
So when you tether your 3G connection to help a friend to access the Internet.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,950
Exactly.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,500
We're going to tether the Internet connection into on our Android device can do it again using 3G or

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,470
using Wi-Fi.

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,750
And if you're getting use wife again the two cards and I'm going to explain that.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
So we're basically going to create an access point.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,450
For example you can call it free internet.

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,100
When people connect to this access point you're automatically the server.

46
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,340
So automatically when they want to go to any Web site they're going to send you the request and when

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,300
you get the request you're going to send their response to them.

48
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,260
So automatically you are the man in the middle and the packets will naturally flow through your device

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,640
which means that you can read intercept and modify them.

50
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,440
Again all of these attacks we're going to talk about them in more detail and we're going to talk about

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,430
what you can do after you become the man in the middle and in the next section will actually see how

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,840
we can mix this with other exploitation methods to gain full access to the target's computers.
