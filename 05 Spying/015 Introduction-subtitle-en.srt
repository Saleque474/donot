1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,720
So usually after you gather enough information about your target then you are ready to carry out the

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,000
attack that you want to do.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,070
So in the next in this section the spying section and then the next section the exploitation.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,210
We're going to talk about how you can actually launch attacks to achieve your goals.

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:30,150
Now on the spying section we're going to be talking about attacks that allow us to get user names passwords

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,190
chat messages any type of sensitive information that might be useful to you.

7
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,770
We're going to talk about three main methods to become the man in the middle as you can see we have

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:49,250
three big circles each one of them represent a different way of becoming the man in the middle.

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:56,120
Now what I mean by becoming the man in the middle is being in the middle of the connection between your

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,680
target and the source of the requests.

11
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,170
So in most of the cases is the server.

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,810
So when you are the man in the middle or the requests and the response is going to and from the target

13
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,110
machine will be combing through your device.

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,770
So your request to any Web site any username and password any chat message anything Argles person does

15
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,280
will be sent to your device then to the Internet.

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,710
And when it comes back it comes to your device then to the target person.

17
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,560
Now as I said we're going to be talking about three different methods to achieve that and why that device

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,750
starts treating you as a man in the middle is different depending on the method.

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,120
Once you're the man in the middle you can read user names you can reach passwords so you can read all

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,250
kind of packets.

21
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,100
You can also intercept the packet so you can modify them.

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,500
So for example of a person is downloading a file you can get him to download a different file without

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,170
them even knowing if they request Facebook dot com you can't take them somewhere else with a fake Facebook

24
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,620
log in you need to do that because you got to be able to get the usernames and passwords anyway.

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,480
You'll be able to sniff cookies you'll be able to sniff passwords usernames you are Elle's images anything

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,230
that goes through the target person and between you after you are the man in the middle we're going

27
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:26,260
to talk about different attacks and different scenarios so you can mix and match these attacks.

28
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,310
So for example if I spoke about a few attacks that you can do using WSP method you can actually do them

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,240
when you're IRP poisoning.

30
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,540
So the method of becoming the man in the middle is irrelevant.

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:47,430
So these small circus circles represent the attacks that you can do after becoming the man in the middle.

32
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,770
And you can do them regardless of the method that you use to achieve becoming the man in the middle.

33
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,840
Also with this section some of the attacks that we're going to learn in this section we're actually

34
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,520
going to carry them out in the next section into bigger scenarios to show you how we can gain full access

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,880
to computers using different methods.
