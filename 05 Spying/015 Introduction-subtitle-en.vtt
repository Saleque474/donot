00:02.340 --> 00:09.720
So usually after you gather enough information about your target then you are ready to carry out the

00:09.720 --> 00:12.000
attack that you want to do.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.070
So in the next in this section the spying section and then the next section the exploitation.

00:17.070 --> 00:22.210
We're going to talk about how you can actually launch attacks to achieve your goals.

00:22.290 --> 00:30.150
Now on the spying section we're going to be talking about attacks that allow us to get user names passwords

00:30.360 --> 00:35.190
chat messages any type of sensitive information that might be useful to you.

00:37.850 --> 00:42.770
We're going to talk about three main methods to become the man in the middle as you can see we have

00:42.770 --> 00:49.250
three big circles each one of them represent a different way of becoming the man in the middle.

00:49.250 --> 00:56.120
Now what I mean by becoming the man in the middle is being in the middle of the connection between your

00:56.120 --> 00:59.680
target and the source of the requests.

00:59.690 --> 01:04.170
So in most of the cases is the server.

01:04.330 --> 01:10.810
So when you are the man in the middle or the requests and the response is going to and from the target

01:10.810 --> 01:14.110
machine will be combing through your device.

01:14.140 --> 01:20.770
So your request to any Web site any username and password any chat message anything Argles person does

01:21.010 --> 01:24.280
will be sent to your device then to the Internet.

01:24.430 --> 01:29.710
And when it comes back it comes to your device then to the target person.

01:29.710 --> 01:35.560
Now as I said we're going to be talking about three different methods to achieve that and why that device

01:35.560 --> 01:39.750
starts treating you as a man in the middle is different depending on the method.

01:40.950 --> 01:45.120
Once you're the man in the middle you can read user names you can reach passwords so you can read all

01:45.120 --> 01:46.250
kind of packets.

01:46.260 --> 01:50.100
You can also intercept the packet so you can modify them.

01:50.100 --> 01:55.500
So for example of a person is downloading a file you can get him to download a different file without

01:55.500 --> 02:01.170
them even knowing if they request Facebook dot com you can't take them somewhere else with a fake Facebook

02:01.170 --> 02:06.620
log in you need to do that because you got to be able to get the usernames and passwords anyway.

02:06.860 --> 02:13.480
You'll be able to sniff cookies you'll be able to sniff passwords usernames you are Elle's images anything

02:13.480 --> 02:20.230
that goes through the target person and between you after you are the man in the middle we're going

02:20.230 --> 02:26.260
to talk about different attacks and different scenarios so you can mix and match these attacks.

02:26.260 --> 02:33.310
So for example if I spoke about a few attacks that you can do using WSP method you can actually do them

02:33.640 --> 02:35.240
when you're IRP poisoning.

02:35.260 --> 02:40.540
So the method of becoming the man in the middle is irrelevant.

02:40.540 --> 02:47.430
So these small circus circles represent the attacks that you can do after becoming the man in the middle.

02:47.590 --> 02:54.770
And you can do them regardless of the method that you use to achieve becoming the man in the middle.

02:55.710 --> 02:59.840
Also with this section some of the attacks that we're going to learn in this section we're actually

02:59.850 --> 03:05.520
going to carry them out in the next section into bigger scenarios to show you how we can gain full access

03:05.640 --> 03:07.880
to computers using different methods.
