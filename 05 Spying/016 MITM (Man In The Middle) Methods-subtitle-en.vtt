00:02.100 --> 00:08.580
So the three main methods that we're going to use to become the man in the middle are the bad USV man

00:08.580 --> 00:13.770
in the middle attack HRP poisoning and evil access point.

00:13.830 --> 00:22.440
So the bad US man in the middle attack will basically allow you to become the man in the middle by connecting

00:22.440 --> 00:26.750
your Android device to the target's laptop or to the computer.

00:26.820 --> 00:32.880
Once you do that the Android device is going to fool that computer that it is a wireless or that is

00:32.880 --> 00:34.930
a network card.

00:34.980 --> 00:41.220
Once it does that it's also going to force all the traffic through the Android device.

00:41.220 --> 00:47.520
So instead of your laptop for example when you go to Google dotcom it's going to use your wireless card

00:47.550 --> 00:54.050
or your wild card and use the means of connection whether you're connected via wire or wireless go to

00:54.060 --> 00:55.470
the router ask for Google.

00:55.470 --> 00:58.600
Bring it back when you connect your Android device to it.

00:58.740 --> 01:02.040
It's actually going to think the card is your Android device.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.740
So when it wants to go to Google dot com it's going to send it to your to your device then your device

01:07.740 --> 01:15.520
using 3G or use an another wireless card will go get Google does come and give it back to the computer.

01:16.050 --> 01:18.420
So your device is the man in the middle.

01:18.420 --> 01:24.720
All the packets will be flowing through your device therefore you can read intercept or modify them.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.430
Again we're going to talk about this in more detail.

01:27.570 --> 01:33.390
And the attacks that you achieve after that you can mix them or you can do them with other man in the

01:33.390 --> 01:34.400
middle attacks.

01:34.410 --> 01:38.550
It doesn't really matter how you become the man in the middle wants or the man in the middle you can

01:38.550 --> 01:40.400
do these attacks anyway.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.750
The second method is used and they are poisoning.

01:44.830 --> 01:48.310
This is a bit more complicated but it's explained in diagrams.

01:48.310 --> 01:52.380
And once you actually understand it it's really simple at the start it's hard to get your head around.

01:52.570 --> 01:57.580
But once you actually go through the lessons it's going to be very simple very powerful very useful

01:57.580 --> 01:58.110
at that.

01:59.480 --> 02:04.620
This is very powerful and useful because you don't need to physically connect to your Android device.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.950
It literally works because of a flaw in a.

02:08.030 --> 02:09.810
And the AARP protocol.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.070
So we're going to talk about this and we can understand how this works.

02:13.100 --> 02:19.670
Once you can actually do this you can run it into you can write on Wired and on wireless networks it's

02:19.670 --> 02:22.700
very powerful and works on all operating systems.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.000
So it is very very useful.

02:25.930 --> 02:31.900
The bad us we attack also works on all operating systems windows and X and Mac and the third method.

02:31.900 --> 02:35.300
We're going to talk about is the evil access point.

02:35.340 --> 02:38.750
So in this method we're actually going to create a wireless network.

02:38.910 --> 02:43.590
So we're going to use our Android device the same way when you do tethering.

02:43.590 --> 02:48.070
So when you tether your 3G connection to help a friend to access the Internet.

02:48.210 --> 02:48.950
Exactly.

02:48.960 --> 02:55.500
We're going to tether the Internet connection into on our Android device can do it again using 3G or

02:55.500 --> 02:56.470
using Wi-Fi.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.750
And if you're getting use wife again the two cards and I'm going to explain that.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.440
So we're basically going to create an access point.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.450
For example you can call it free internet.

03:07.570 --> 03:11.100
When people connect to this access point you're automatically the server.

03:11.110 --> 03:17.340
So automatically when they want to go to any Web site they're going to send you the request and when

03:17.440 --> 03:20.300
you get the request you're going to send their response to them.

03:20.350 --> 03:26.260
So automatically you are the man in the middle and the packets will naturally flow through your device

03:26.470 --> 03:31.640
which means that you can read intercept and modify them.

03:31.690 --> 03:35.440
Again all of these attacks we're going to talk about them in more detail and we're going to talk about

03:35.740 --> 03:42.430
what you can do after you become the man in the middle and in the next section will actually see how

03:42.430 --> 03:47.840
we can mix this with other exploitation methods to gain full access to the target's computers.
