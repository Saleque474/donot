00:01.350 --> 00:04.290
OK so here I have my windows device.

00:04.320 --> 00:09.560
And as you can see I cannot login without a password so the computer is locked.

00:09.570 --> 00:12.210
Now I'm going to try to log in without a password.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.610
I'm just going to hit enter.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.850
And as you can see I can't log in without a password.

00:17.670 --> 00:22.650
I'm also going to try to put in a lot random password and try to log in.

00:22.740 --> 00:27.470
And again as you can see I can't log in without a password or with a random password.

00:27.810 --> 00:33.060
So what I'm going to do now is use the Android device that we use set up and the previous video to boot

00:33.090 --> 00:37.210
from or to use it as a bootable conduit.

00:37.350 --> 00:41.090
I'm going to connect it using the US mistake right here.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.130
So I'm going to connect it to the target device.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.440
Then I'm going to restart the device.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.960
And when it starts I'm going to go on the BIOS setup menu and make sure that it is set up to boot from

01:08.050 --> 01:09.030
us.

01:09.460 --> 01:13.290
So I'm going to press you on this device on or on this laptop.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.930
It's you have to press to two iTunes devices.

01:15.940 --> 01:19.110
No it's different from computer to computer.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.680
I'm going to navigate to the boot options as you can see here.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.960
And I've already done this.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.300
I've moved the USP of all the way to the top.

01:29.560 --> 01:35.530
Now depending on the computer again sometimes you use the plus and minus to move options to the top

01:36.160 --> 01:37.320
on this computer.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.860
I have to use six to move it to the top.

01:41.080 --> 01:49.690
So it is already set up to boot from US v and I'm going to exit this BIOS and it should now boot from

01:50.200 --> 01:55.560
or using Can good use in the image that is stored on my Android device.

01:58.150 --> 02:00.460
So as you can see there conduit is booting up

02:04.050 --> 02:10.390
and it should allow me to log into that Windows computer without a password and without modifying the

02:10.410 --> 02:12.440
passwords for existing users.

02:12.450 --> 02:16.920
So when I restarted the user should be able to log in with their own passwords.

02:25.780 --> 02:30.870
Now again I'm being asked for the password but this time I'm going to log in without that it is you

02:30.870 --> 02:39.950
think I'm just going to hit enter.

02:40.060 --> 02:45.680
As you can see I was able to log in to the computer without a password even though before we used to

02:45.690 --> 02:49.820
convert we had to use or we couldn't log in without a password.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.760
But now I was able to log into the computer without a password and I can use the computer now.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.580
Moronic rhinovirus run a backdoor a key log or whatever you want to do.

03:01.610 --> 03:07.700
So it's a really useful tool to use if you're doing any physical hacking or if you have a physical access

03:08.030 --> 03:16.380
to a computer because in many situations you would have a system or you'd have a computer that you can

03:16.380 --> 03:16.920
access.

03:16.950 --> 03:23.040
The user is not there but they have their computer shut down or they have it they loved out of that

03:23.040 --> 03:24.450
computer.

03:24.450 --> 03:30.550
Now what I want to show you I'm just going to restart again and I'll show you that once you restart

03:30.990 --> 03:36.420
you want to be able to log in without a password and the passwords for the existing users will not be

03:36.420 --> 03:37.090
modified.

03:37.320 --> 03:42.870
So the user will be able to log in with their old password so they won't know that someone hacked into

03:42.870 --> 03:44.920
their account or do something with it.

04:08.400 --> 04:15.090
So again I booted up again but without using computer I'm going to try to log in without a password.

04:16.290 --> 04:22.650
And as you can see I can't log in I'm going to put my old password so the user password

04:29.750 --> 04:34.170
and as you can see I will be able to log in and the password was not modified.
