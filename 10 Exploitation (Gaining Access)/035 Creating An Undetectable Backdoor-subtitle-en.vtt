00:05.980 --> 00:11.640
The next few videos we're going to talk about some contacts that you will need to have a backdoor that

00:11.640 --> 00:15.410
will spawn a shell back to your device.

00:15.420 --> 00:22.410
So I decided to make a video to explain to you how to create a backdoor and how to test this backdoor

00:22.410 --> 00:28.710
so I'm going to explain it was so that in the future when we do more sophisticated attacks I can skip

00:28.710 --> 00:33.030
this step because you know how to do it and you know how to test if it works or not.

00:34.340 --> 00:38.690
So to do this we're actually going to use a tool called Divell evasion.

00:38.720 --> 00:46.850
The reason I'm using this tool is because it creates factors that are not detectable by any antivirus.

00:46.850 --> 00:52.970
So when you create a backdoor and this and this tool the antivirus programs will not detect this as

00:52.970 --> 00:53.600
a threat.

00:54.340 --> 01:00.490
So in order to solve it all you have to do is just apt get install Bill evasion in your terminal and

01:00.490 --> 01:04.740
Cali the process might take some time.

01:04.740 --> 01:08.570
It's going to download around 600 megabytes of packages.

01:09.580 --> 01:13.680
Just every time you asked to do something always say YES YES YES YES YES.

01:13.790 --> 01:15.990
Until the installation is finished.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.280
So it's very straightforward.

01:17.280 --> 01:27.170
Or you have to do is just go here you have to get Misto they'll evey you hit enter and it'll are solved

01:27.180 --> 01:27.410
for you.

01:27.410 --> 01:31.980
Now for me it's saying that it's already installed so I don't need to install it.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.530
Now once you have it installed I'm going to run it using the same command.

01:35.530 --> 01:45.460
So Bill evasion going to hit enter and as you can see now I have 45 notes loaded so that's 45 different

01:45.460 --> 01:48.290
types of doctors that I can create.

01:48.700 --> 01:56.530
If you want to list all these payloads and see what you have you can just type in list to see them that's

01:56.530 --> 02:03.510
all the payload that you can create so far today is on for the next videos we're going to be use and

02:03.840 --> 02:07.340
see as Mr. Patel reverse TTP.

02:07.360 --> 02:14.980
So in order to use this you all you have to do is just type in use 8 because that was number 8.

02:15.050 --> 02:17.750
So now has shown me the options that this has.

02:17.750 --> 02:23.410
And you can use this the same way we were use in me just like in the previous videos the same way you

02:23.420 --> 02:29.150
when you want to change an option you type insert option name and then the value that you want to change

02:29.150 --> 02:29.870
it to.

02:29.870 --> 02:32.060
So you again do this the exact same way.

02:32.060 --> 02:37.320
So for example to set up our IP Address this is our local IP address.

02:37.550 --> 02:45.540
So l host same way that we were doing it with me to exploit all you have to do is type in set host and

02:45.690 --> 02:47.460
put your IP address.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.520
So to see our IP address we type in if configure

02:53.420 --> 02:57.690
as you can see that my IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 4.

02:57.740 --> 03:03.600
So I'm going to put that here now I'm doing this because we're going to do a verse connection.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.280
So the target machine will be the machine that connects back to us.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.870
Now to make sure that the options are right I'm going to type it in full again and we can see that my

03:12.870 --> 03:18.420
IP address is set up here and then we can see the fourth right here so we have to set this up when we

03:18.420 --> 03:22.660
do the multi-hundred like we did in the previous video.

03:23.610 --> 03:25.770
So now everything's done I'm going to type and generate

03:28.640 --> 03:36.030
and I'm going to type in the name of the file to create So I'm going to call it backdoor.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.800
Now in practice you do you don't want to call your backdoor backdoor.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.800
But for now we're testing so I'm going to call it back door.

03:42.980 --> 03:47.410
And it's created and it's saying it's written to this file.

03:47.450 --> 03:55.970
So my backdoor is stored in user share Bill output compiled backdoor to eat now you get the Yangtze

03:56.040 --> 04:02.130
you can send it to any computer once you're on the cxxviii it will try to connect back to your device

04:02.550 --> 04:05.000
on port 80 80 like we set it up.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.760
So how do we listen to that what we're doing.

04:10.760 --> 04:16.640
We're going to do with the same way we did it when we arrived our first flight option.

04:16.770 --> 04:19.860
So I'm going to run MSF Canso.

04:20.070 --> 04:22.270
I'm going to quit this so I'm going to type in

04:25.320 --> 04:30.300
that exit and then I'm going to write myself.

04:30.390 --> 04:34.470
So.

04:34.550 --> 04:42.340
So the next few steps are going to be exactly the same steps that we did when we did our first flight

04:42.340 --> 04:44.540
option with the idea of what the tag.

04:44.590 --> 04:49.840
So this will basically just allow us to listen on port 80 80 for incoming connections.

04:50.110 --> 04:52.540
So I'm going to use exploits

04:55.210 --> 04:58.410
that I actually don't need to on this come on now because I'm already in it.

04:58.580 --> 05:02.070
Well just to show you how to do it then I'm going to set my payload

05:04.690 --> 05:06.070
to Windows.

05:06.100 --> 05:15.160
Same thing or that we chose one we created the payload so it was Windows interpolator reverse a TTP.

05:15.390 --> 05:26.090
I said the old fart to 88 like we did it before and I'm going I said my host 2 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 14 the

05:26.090 --> 05:31.900
same values that we set up with the back door.

05:31.920 --> 05:35.870
So now we're just making sure that everything is right and everything is right.

05:35.910 --> 05:42.320
So I'm going to type in exploit and now listen in on connections so know I'm going to do now is I'm

05:42.320 --> 05:46.970
going to go I'm going to copy this file to my target Windows machine.

05:46.970 --> 05:49.360
Again this is not a practical attack.

05:49.430 --> 05:54.140
I just want to show you how to create a backdoor and how to test this back there so I'm actually going

05:54.140 --> 05:59.720
to send this file to the target machine and run it from the target machine and we'll see if this works

05:59.720 --> 06:00.030
or not.

06:00.050 --> 06:04.850
So if it works we're going to use it in the future videos to carry out our attacks.

06:07.340 --> 06:10.480
Now I have the file here so I'm going to double click it.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.200
I'm going to run it.

06:15.540 --> 06:23.420
And if we go back here as you can see we got an interpreter session back from this IP which is our target

06:23.420 --> 06:25.790
IP to our IP.

06:25.790 --> 06:31.690
And if we do this info we will see that we are inside the target machine.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.070
This is actually really useful.

06:35.070 --> 06:41.550
So even without this course or without these things that you're going to learn and this course created

06:41.570 --> 06:45.880
a backdoor is really simple and comes in handy into many many situations.

06:45.930 --> 06:51.960
So using villi can create a backdoor that is not detectable by any anti-virus and it can confirm this

06:52.050 --> 06:58.390
using your own anti-virus but please don't upload it to the websites that test for multiple antivirus

06:58.390 --> 07:03.660
is because they usually analyze the backdoor and then it's a want to be undetectable anymore.

07:04.110 --> 07:08.770
So what it creates them undetectable and there are safe Web sites that you can test with.

07:08.940 --> 07:13.860
I'm going to put them and the resources to test your backdoor with and they're not detectable again

07:13.890 --> 07:17.080
by antivirus is that it works to give you a reverse connection.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.640
And it's really small.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.900
So in the future videos we're going to need to use backorders.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.010
I'm going to skip through this step because we already know how to make them.
