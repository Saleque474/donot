WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:07.180
OK so we saw before how we can connect our Android phone physically to a laptop and then have it to

00:07.230 --> 00:13.710
pretend to be a keyboard and then program the Android device to send certain commands to this laptop

00:13.710 --> 00:20.790
so we saw how we can add a username and password with a password and add the user name to the administrators

00:21.120 --> 00:26.750
and then remotely connect to the target laptop from another computer.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.710
Or from our Android device.

00:30.720 --> 00:37.580
Now the problem is the privileges on the logged in user does not allow you to add new user.

00:37.580 --> 00:42.890
Another problem is a Remote Desktop might not might not be enabled on the target computer.

00:43.100 --> 00:48.260
So if you actually want to gain full access to the target computer you're better off using the power

00:48.260 --> 00:49.700
split option.

00:49.700 --> 00:56.510
This option allow you to get a reverse shield so you get full access to the target's computer and you

00:56.510 --> 01:02.900
will then be able to escalate your privileges change your privileges maybe to administrator you can

01:02.900 --> 01:05.350
add usernames and passwords from this show.

01:05.390 --> 01:11.840
You can change the shell to the NCCL and then you'll see everything like most desktop you can do much

01:11.840 --> 01:17.420
more things you can start and I think you basically get a reverse interpreter handler which is part

01:17.420 --> 01:20.100
of the meta both you will see what the other means now.

01:20.420 --> 01:26.210
Basically it gives you a very powerful shell that gives you full access to the salvias computer.

01:26.640 --> 01:32.440
So the main attack method is the same so we will be using our Android device to fool the target computer

01:32.530 --> 01:33.480
as a keyboard.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.680
So we're going to have to connect our Android device physically to the tablet computer.

01:37.730 --> 01:41.150
Once we do this we will get a reverse show on another machine.

01:42.430 --> 01:46.510
Now where we get the Universe will depend on what we want to do.

01:46.510 --> 01:51.460
We can actually do it get the reverse show on the Android or we can get the reverse show on another

01:51.460 --> 01:52.220
computer.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.450
Certainly won't see anywhere else that we want.

01:56.770 --> 02:01.130
All you need to use is a tool called me that's Floyd.

02:01.300 --> 02:08.620
So I'm using calisthenics right here as a virtual machine and I have my terminal open and I'm going

02:08.620 --> 02:15.770
to show you how we are going to set up our handler so we can make our Android device to the target machine.

02:15.820 --> 02:21.740
It's going to do a reverse connection instead of us connecting to the with computer from Cali.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.830
We're going to program our Android device to send commands to the Windows machine to make it connect

02:26.890 --> 02:28.320
to the kalee.

02:28.330 --> 02:32.980
We're doing a reverse connection this way so that we can bypass firewalls.

02:32.980 --> 02:38.380
So this is my Callimachi and this is where I'm going to get my reverse connection so you can run these

02:38.380 --> 02:43.150
commands on any computer or device that has metal plate installed on it.

02:43.150 --> 02:46.380
Again you can do this on your Android device in the terminal.

02:46.510 --> 02:50.110
You can do these commands and you get the shield back into your Android.

02:50.110 --> 02:54.630
But I'm doing it here on a different computer because in this scenario when you actually want to connect

02:54.650 --> 02:59.090
your computer your device to another computer you will look suspicious.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.000
Then using your device and you'll have a terminal and stuff on your device.

03:03.040 --> 03:09.190
So the best stealth way to do it is you connect your Android device to the computer and then the show

03:09.190 --> 03:11.410
goes back to another laptop somewhere else.

03:11.410 --> 03:12.990
So this is what we're actually doing.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.240
This is a virtual machine right here.

03:16.470 --> 03:22.720
The first command I'm going to run is to run dimittis bloweth console and it's MSF console.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.930
This will take some time to load up the whole the whole plate framework.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.840
Now with us bloat is a huge framework that can be used into many many different things.

03:31.860 --> 03:39.160
So today we're only looking on how to set up a reverse handler and get a reverse connection on its.

03:39.220 --> 03:48.430
So in order to do that we're going to do use exploit multiday there.

03:48.550 --> 03:52.600
So this is the auxilary that we're going to use.

03:52.870 --> 03:55.060
It's called exploit multi handler.

03:55.090 --> 04:00.850
Then I'm going to type in Show Options now you can run show options at any stage to see the options

04:00.850 --> 04:02.730
that you have or you can set.

04:02.980 --> 04:05.950
So you can see that the module options are these.

04:06.100 --> 04:11.110
And the payload is set this is correctly so you might not actually have the payload set up correctly.

04:11.110 --> 04:17.460
The payload is the type of code that will ponder verst connection.

04:17.470 --> 04:23.480
So in my case we're going to either use a reverse hasty CPS or a very safe city.

04:23.650 --> 04:27.610
So I'm going to send the payload I'm actually just going to change it to show you how to change the

04:27.610 --> 04:33.160
payload because when you run it for the first time you're going to have a blank for payloads.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.300
So I'm just going to show you how to change the payload.

04:35.330 --> 04:40.490
Now you can do this changing the payload is the same no matter what you are doing even if you're on

04:40.490 --> 04:41.820
a different tack.

04:42.080 --> 04:56.530
So you just go said haloed those interpretor reverse HTP and we can see that the payload will change.

04:56.730 --> 05:01.380
Now if you want to change the airport or the host it's the same for me to change them.

05:01.380 --> 05:04.590
So if you change the host is the listening host.

05:04.710 --> 05:07.160
So it's the IP of this current machine.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.630
I'm just going to see what's the IP of this machine using ifconfig.

05:11.670 --> 05:15.170
So that's just a Linux command to see the IP.

05:15.240 --> 05:19.670
So my IP is 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 14.

05:19.870 --> 05:21.600
So I'm going to do it again.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.180
So it's the same format.

05:23.260 --> 05:27.480
You type in set and then you type in the name of the variable that you want to change.

05:27.490 --> 05:38.120
So the variable for me now is I'll host and I want to set it to 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 4 2 Okay.

05:38.180 --> 05:41.790
So I'm going to do show options again to make sure that all the options are correct.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.810
So we're using the.

05:43.820 --> 05:47.160
They have their windows with their fraternally very safe.

05:47.930 --> 05:54.620
This is my IP and this is the fourth and the target is Windows or wild card so everything's perfect.

05:54.650 --> 06:00.760
Now once you're ready we're going to type in exploit as you can see this doesn't really do anything.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.370
It just sits and waits for connections.

06:03.370 --> 06:07.210
Come on 4 4 4 4 4.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.410
So it's not going to do anything.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.540
It's not going to try to hike or run any exploits.

06:12.540 --> 06:19.200
It's basically just waiting for any device to connect to it on 4 4 4 4 4.

06:19.340 --> 06:24.860
Again you can run these commands on any device that has meters Floyd including your net Hunter device

06:24.890 --> 06:26.580
if you want to do it from it.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.580
Now we're all set.

06:27.590 --> 06:28.670
Everything is ready.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.880
So we're going to go on our hunter machine

06:35.010 --> 06:37.790
some minor Hunter home and I'm going out.

06:37.800 --> 06:44.570
First thing I'm going to navigate to my ex-service control and I'm going to turn on my apache server

06:44.600 --> 06:45.850
by tapping on it.

06:46.250 --> 06:51.350
So Apache is on now then I'm going to go to my page.

06:51.400 --> 06:57.150
The keyboard attack and I'm going to make sure that all these options are correct.

06:57.170 --> 07:04.970
So the first thing is our IP address and that is correct 1 9 3 1 6 8 0 14 that's the IP where the connection

07:04.970 --> 07:05.750
will be sent to.

07:05.750 --> 07:12.860
So that's the IP of the Kalli machine that we run with smote on and it's the same you put in the same

07:12.860 --> 07:17.170
IP as the one that we put as the host here.

07:17.180 --> 07:25.150
So as you can see that my host is one of six age 14 and it's the same as this one second option is my

07:25.150 --> 07:25.540
forte.

07:25.540 --> 07:28.480
Again make sure it's the same so it's 4 4 4 4.

07:28.510 --> 07:30.830
The third option the payload.

07:30.830 --> 07:37.210
Again make sure it's the same windows interpreter Reverse-Flash CTP and then the last one is the IP.

07:37.210 --> 07:43.210
Now this should be the IP of your Android device and it's the same as what we saw in the home menu.

07:43.210 --> 07:49.160
So it's 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 8 and that's why we turned on our Apache server.

07:49.170 --> 07:53.690
So Apache is a web server and that's where the payload is going to be stored.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.230
So once we execute the attack the payload will be downloaded from the Android device.

07:59.280 --> 08:05.450
It will be executed on the windows the target machine and it will send that connection to the machine

08:05.450 --> 08:06.370
that runs with us.

08:06.370 --> 08:12.280
Floyds which is in this case the Callimachi and the virtual machine so I'm going to hit on these three

08:12.280 --> 08:18.450
little dots and I'm going to hit on execute attack and I'm going to navigate quickly to my windows.

08:18.850 --> 08:23.950
And as you can see now these are these commands that are actually being typed automatically the same

08:23.950 --> 08:30.180
way that what happened when we ran our CMBS or page I.D. keyboard the tag when we typed in that user

08:30.180 --> 08:31.750
or user or whatever.

08:31.750 --> 08:37.390
Now this will actually download the payload from the Android device execute the payload in this machine

08:37.720 --> 08:40.420
and then spawn a show on this machine.

08:40.570 --> 08:45.760
And as we can see we have access to the target's Windows machine so we can see that we have a session

08:45.760 --> 08:46.850
one open.

08:47.080 --> 08:53.750
It's come into this IP which is our IP and it's coming from 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 2 which is my Windows device

08:54.860 --> 09:02.220
and now I have basically full access and full control over the target machine using my interpreter.

09:02.220 --> 09:07.420
Now I will give you a quick showcase of what you can do once you're in this situation.
