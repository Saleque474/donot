WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:06.910
So in the previous video we show how we can gain an interpreter session on the target machine.

00:07.140 --> 00:12.050
And today I'm just going to show you a few things that you could run or do with your own interpreter

00:12.050 --> 00:12.800
session.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.790
Now again as I said before people take full courses in order to learn how to use with us.

00:17.820 --> 00:22.700
Lloyd so far today we're just going to have a quick look and quick hands on the things that you can

00:22.700 --> 00:23.630
do.

00:23.630 --> 00:31.100
Most important thing keep in mind you can always just type in help and it'll show you all the command

00:31.100 --> 00:32.480
that you can run.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.250
So that's a really helpful thing.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.060
And then you can see what you can do.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.410
So the first thing I'd like to do was something inside the system.

00:39.500 --> 00:45.850
I'd go six ANFO just to get the information of the current system to get to know.

00:45.860 --> 00:49.110
So now we can see that we the computer name is zoos.

00:49.320 --> 00:54.240
It's running Windows 8 x 64 and and the interpreter is 32.

00:54.410 --> 01:01.700
The system language is English you as you can also do an ifconfig to get the interfaces and get their

01:01.700 --> 01:02.990
IP address and all that.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.860
So we can see that it's used in the US we are less careful.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.480
But we can see the MAC address we can see the IP address.

01:09.530 --> 01:15.170
So all this is useful depending on what you want to do with the target machine.

01:15.170 --> 01:19.610
Now we can see that we have another interface here that is not connected.

01:19.610 --> 01:23.230
We have another interface so this is a wired interface.

01:23.300 --> 01:27.440
Again we can see its IP address and its MAC address.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.870
So on other interface right here.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.870
So this is just kind of useful information that we can see of the target machine.

01:36.350 --> 01:41.510
Also you can do as you can see what's your working directory where are you working right now so we're

01:41.510 --> 01:44.920
in C users and this is the user name that we have.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.480
Also we can list all the directories and the files that you have use and Alias.

01:50.570 --> 01:57.350
So this so that's the list all directories that exist in C users and then the users that we're in and

01:57.350 --> 02:02.730
we can see this is all the files that exist and directories.

02:02.750 --> 02:09.710
So let's say you want to go to desktop or you can go see the desktop.

02:09.780 --> 02:14.340
Now if you do PDA and you did see the working directory you see are in desktop.

02:14.790 --> 02:18.850
So we're going to do a list to see all the files that exist in desktop.

02:19.080 --> 02:26.410
And as you can see that there is nothing really except for those of gold I need now let's say this file

02:26.560 --> 02:33.900
is important file that you want to read so you can just read it using cathe command.

02:33.930 --> 02:37.770
Now all these commands again are aren't the help so you can just go through the help and see them and

02:37.770 --> 02:41.220
now you can see what the 12. only contains.

02:41.220 --> 02:45.150
Now let's say you want to download this file and save it to your hard drive.

02:45.150 --> 02:53.210
You can just do download this self-taught any and it's downloaded it now for me.

02:53.210 --> 03:00.790
So if I go into my working into my home folder as you can see that I can see I have a file called sculped

03:00.940 --> 03:01.290
ID

03:04.260 --> 03:06.150
Lets say you want to upload something.

03:06.150 --> 03:13.320
Now again I have here I have a file called said that the Axion has not it just has a I'm going to upload

03:13.320 --> 03:21.040
the file but in practice you'd be uploading more dangerous things like viruses kill ogres reverse Yeo's

03:21.210 --> 03:22.070
stuff like that.

03:23.660 --> 03:29.170
So for now we're just going to upload something simple so we're going to do upload that do it takes

03:29.210 --> 03:32.980
the and now the file is uploaded.

03:32.980 --> 03:38.540
If we do a list we can see it right here if we do I have to make sure that it contains.

03:38.660 --> 03:40.680
It was uploaded properly.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.060
It will see that it actually contains AAA.

03:43.130 --> 03:48.150
Now if this was an executable you can execute it using execute.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.490
And then you put the file name which is the.

03:52.820 --> 03:58.310
Now this will give me an error now because it's not an executable saying it's not valid Win32 application

03:58.630 --> 04:03.690
but if it was executed on the target machine.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.820
Now this is just like file handling.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.940
Uploading doing stuff like that.

04:07.990 --> 04:10.820
Let's go again on the help and see what else we can do.

04:10.840 --> 04:15.470
So again you can even get scripts and you can get plugins that you use with interpolator.

04:15.550 --> 04:18.290
I'm not going to go through them in this course.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.990
So let me see what else.

04:19.990 --> 04:24.580
So you'll be using to use and run through on plugins or no plugins.

04:24.780 --> 04:30.320
And so these were the commands that we were using the file system commands see the upload download.

04:30.410 --> 04:34.920
You can make directories you can remove used in our search.

04:35.050 --> 04:40.820
So basically just you just put the command name on the command that you want to run.

04:40.910 --> 04:46.820
You also have your network commands right here so you can type in R.P. to get the AARP cash or display

04:46.820 --> 04:52.770
interfaces and although we saw ifconfig how to display the interfaces these are the system command so

04:52.770 --> 04:56.060
we use the execute to execute an executable.

04:56.180 --> 05:01.790
You can clear events log where you can get the process number that we're working right now.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.710
Now you can get the user ID.

05:04.860 --> 05:12.910
So if you do get the it will show you the process that you're working on can do a PSA to see all the

05:12.910 --> 05:15.280
processes that's running right now.

05:15.580 --> 05:23.050
And something cool that you can do so because you're running now on this process are 3 7 8 8 and you

05:23.050 --> 05:24.880
can see that it is a suspicious thing.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.550
So it's called partial.

05:26.800 --> 05:32.590
What you can do is you can do emigrate migrate so you can migrate to a different process that is less

05:32.770 --> 05:36.340
suspicious than the process that you're using right now.

05:36.340 --> 05:40.400
So what we can do is we can look look for Explorer dirty.

05:40.960 --> 05:49.000
And as you can see that it is running on to nine to eight so in order to migrate to that process we're

05:49.000 --> 06:02.940
going to do great 2 2 9 8 and this will basically move our show from powerslide into ex-parte RTX.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.760
So let's get the idea.

06:06.850 --> 06:10.330
And as you can see that we're actually running now through explorer.

06:10.390 --> 06:15.400
If someone looks at the processes we're going to show up as if we're running from the Explorer or not

06:15.460 --> 06:25.230
from the partial We saw the system info and still talking is an attempt to steal the token can use shell

06:25.230 --> 06:29.520
which will give you a command show I'll show that to you later.

06:29.530 --> 06:34.990
It'll basically just give you a Windows Comanche and you can run Windows command through it can kill

06:35.020 --> 06:36.820
processes you can do reboot.

06:36.820 --> 06:42.790
You can modify registry so you can just keep playing around with it and see what you can do.

06:46.510 --> 06:51.520
So let's have a look on this option so this will basically allow you to insert the key logger which

06:51.520 --> 06:54.370
will record any keystroke typed on the keyboard.

06:55.430 --> 07:03.360
So in order to do this it's really simple it's just keys can start and that will start recording any

07:03.370 --> 07:05.780
keystroke I put on my target computer.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.990
So I'm going to go on say for example Google dot com.

07:11.450 --> 07:17.010
Actually let's go to G-mail and start to sign in now.

07:17.010 --> 07:21.260
It doesn't matter if it's using CTP as or if it's used in the latest security

07:24.510 --> 07:30.740
because it's going to record our physical keyboard strikes so it doesn't matter if it's used the CPS

07:30.780 --> 07:33.010
or not it's actually not sniffing anything.

07:33.090 --> 07:39.020
So let's put the password as one two three four five six seven eight.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.740
And when I come back here and do a quick scan

07:45.900 --> 07:48.200
we can see that we went on Google.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.560
We typed in return.

07:49.560 --> 07:56.970
We went to G-mail we typed in return it went down down down down down up return because I actually didn't

07:56.970 --> 07:59.100
type in say that as a security at all.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.770
I just selected it from there.

08:00.810 --> 08:02.060
But we recorded.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.640
The password was 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8.

08:06.060 --> 08:12.670
And then we had to return and not stop this we can just do Keef's can stop that and stop it.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.970
So we can you can experiment with this.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.540
There's a lot of other plug ins that you can do you can actually inject or upload interpretor sessions

08:21.540 --> 08:25.810
that work as services that will start every time the computer starts.

08:25.830 --> 08:31.080
So you can upload one like this and have it running in the background every time your target computer

08:31.080 --> 08:34.050
starts so you will have access to it anytime you want.

08:34.050 --> 08:39.590
You can play with this you can do a lot of things that are really cool and powerful attacks using it.

08:39.840 --> 08:44.790
But I'm not going to talk about all of them again because as I said you'll need a full course for this

08:45.180 --> 08:50.140
and this course is basically just talking about penetration testing use in Android.

08:50.220 --> 08:56.040
One more feature I want to show you is if you just go on show it will go into Windows.

08:56.080 --> 09:02.280
Also this is a normal Windows Shell as you can see see windows so you can run Windows commands so you

09:02.280 --> 09:11.210
can do dare to list stuff you can do cd to see the so see the door does you go back see you go again

09:11.240 --> 09:15.550
then you can go see the users and do any Windows commands that you want to do.
