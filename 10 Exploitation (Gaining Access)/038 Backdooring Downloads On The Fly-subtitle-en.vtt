WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:07.890
So and the previous video we saw how we can replace a file that is being downloaded by a target computer

00:08.160 --> 00:12.410
with another file and we replace any X with a backdoor.

00:12.510 --> 00:18.420
So one of the first lines that he asks that we gained full access to their computer of course we had

00:18.420 --> 00:22.010
to do this while we were in the middle.

00:22.060 --> 00:27.530
The problem is when the what we actually did we replaced the file that was being downloaded.

00:27.670 --> 00:34.600
So when the person ran the file the file that worked did not produce the result that the user was expecting.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.510
For example let's say the user was downloading 7 zip when they double clicked it.

00:39.910 --> 00:42.850
Our back to around 7 zip didn't run.

00:42.850 --> 00:46.620
So the user might suspect us something went wrong.

00:47.050 --> 00:52.990
Well they can manually go ahead before the user downloads anything try to backdoor 7 zip and replace

00:52.990 --> 00:53.930
it with 7.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.460
But you never know what the target person is going to download anyway.

00:58.540 --> 01:04.660
So what we're going to use today is a proxy called the backdoor factory proxy where this proxy will

01:04.660 --> 01:11.710
do is on the fly as the person decides to download the file whether the file is an easy or easy.

01:12.070 --> 01:14.610
It's going to back up this file.

01:14.830 --> 01:20.770
So it's going to use the same file that it's been downloaded and our backdoor to it.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.930
So when the person runs it is going to look like as if they are running their actual file and the actual

01:25.930 --> 01:32.910
file will work it's not going to be corrupt and our backdoor is going to run at the same time.

01:33.060 --> 01:36.640
This will work against Windows OS X machines.

01:37.650 --> 01:43.290
So the first thing you want to do is you want to go on your configuration file for the backdoor factory

01:44.070 --> 01:47.530
and modify and add your IP address in there.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.800
So let me go there and show you.

01:50.070 --> 01:55.200
So we're going to put the IP address where we want to get the show and previous videos we were actually

01:55.200 --> 01:58.070
sent in the show to our the next machine.

01:58.170 --> 02:04.190
Today we're going to get the shell here on our hunter machine just because we're not connecting it to

02:04.280 --> 02:07.800
USP it's going to be a wireless attack and I'll show you how to do it.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.990
It's exactly the same.

02:08.990 --> 02:12.960
We're going to use with us voice and multi-hundred to listen on a port.

02:13.140 --> 02:17.840
So we're going to be run the exact same commands that we run on Linux in order to listen for a.

02:18.710 --> 02:22.500
Now before we do that I go to the configuration file.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.590
So I'll show you what it is.

02:23.590 --> 02:32.120
I already have it open here so I have a route so far here downloaded from the paste are free and simple

02:32.200 --> 02:33.290
and works.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.360
So data local Karlee.

02:37.570 --> 02:38.180
If you see

02:41.370 --> 02:46.350
bact or proxied and then click on the configuration file.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.380
Now I'm not going to change anything in this file.

02:48.380 --> 02:56.480
The only thing that I'm going to change is my current IP address because this proxy backdoor is any

02:56.720 --> 03:03.710
downloaded zip or eat or wrocÅ‚aw is executables what you want to do if you start a multi-hundred or

03:03.710 --> 03:04.860
on only one file.

03:04.970 --> 03:10.430
You're only going to receive one type of shelves so you will not be able to receive shelves for different

03:10.430 --> 03:11.720
operating systems.

03:11.720 --> 03:18.560
So what this does it actually comes in with with a test flight script that runs a number of hands are

03:18.560 --> 03:24.610
instances simultaneously so that you can listen on different parts for different operating systems.

03:24.800 --> 03:32.140
So you can see here if you scroll down you'll see that it's going to ask you to put your IP address

03:32.140 --> 03:35.740
for the next payloads for the Windows payloads.

03:35.740 --> 03:42.460
Now fix that for the Windows payloads and I put my IP address which is 1 9 2 1 6 8 17.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.840
This is my IP address of this net Hunter device.

03:47.110 --> 03:50.530
And as you can see here I have that on here for this device.

03:50.530 --> 03:57.310
And also note the Fords and you can see that it's asking you for Macintosh as well.

03:57.430 --> 04:04.020
And you can also modify the type of payload that's going to be executed or that's going to be used for

04:04.050 --> 04:07.560
each of these operating systems.

04:07.570 --> 04:14.190
So in order to listen to the parts you can run the script that comes in with back to our factory use

04:14.190 --> 04:20.340
in this command so we're going to do most of console are that use the scripts but as you can see here

04:20.630 --> 04:25.570
now today I'm not going to use the script because it runs a number of instances and is going to put

04:25.570 --> 04:29.060
a lot of load on my hunter device.

04:29.200 --> 04:34.600
So I'm actually going to use a manual multi-hundred like we did it before and I'm only going to listen

04:34.930 --> 04:39.670
for the Windows connections because I'm going to be targeting a Windows device so I'm only going to

04:39.670 --> 04:46.390
be listening for the Windows connections for the X 86 which is this one 1 4 8 8 4 4 3.

04:46.390 --> 04:51.730
So I actually don't need this file right now but I'm just showing you if you want to use the script

04:52.370 --> 04:56.490
you would put your IPs in there and then you run the script using this command.

04:57.620 --> 04:59.360
So for me I'm just going to do it manually.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.380
I'll do it next.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.930
But before I do that I'm going to do.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.690
I'm going to start my back backdoor factory.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.120
And after I do that we're going to do the same what we did with the SSL strip.

05:11.220 --> 05:16.380
We're going to use IP tables to redirect any packet coming on port 80.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.710
We're going to redirect it to 88.

05:19.020 --> 05:23.560
We're going to do this because our factory runs on port 88.

05:23.580 --> 05:30.040
You can change just from the same configuration here that we were looking at just a second ago but I'm

05:30.270 --> 05:35.380
leaving it at 88 so we're going to redirect any packet coming at 80 to 88.

05:35.550 --> 05:41.640
So that's our factory can analyze it if it finds that it is an executable It's a backdoor for us and

05:41.640 --> 05:44.040
then we can hide the target's computer.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.130
So this is what I'm going to do next.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.750
Let's go on my Kelly machine.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.280
I'm going to go on my terminal's

05:54.230 --> 06:03.850
and I'm going to run box just as simple as I'll give it two seconds to load and that's it.

06:03.850 --> 06:07.140
Back to our factories is working now the next thing you want to do.

06:07.140 --> 06:12.970
As I said is run IP tables in order to redirect any packet coming on port 80 to 88.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.280
We're back to our factories running.

06:15.430 --> 06:19.240
So I have the command here and I'm going to just have a..

06:19.240 --> 06:23.890
And you don't see any error messages that means the command was ran successfully.

06:23.890 --> 06:27.370
Now I'm going to run my test flight in order to listen.

06:27.400 --> 06:32.890
So I'm going to type in MSF console in order to listen on the forward for Windows machines.

06:32.890 --> 06:38.230
Now again if you're if you're not recording videos and there isn't much pressure on your laptop on your

06:38.830 --> 06:40.450
device then you can do.

06:40.450 --> 06:46.000
You can run it using this command but for me I'm going to just do it manually and only listen for Windows

06:46.000 --> 06:46.680
machines.

06:46.750 --> 06:50.560
If you use this command you're going to be listening to all different types of machines that you can

06:50.560 --> 06:57.060
target using backdoor factory the method that I'm explaining right now you can run it from Cali to the

06:57.080 --> 07:01.290
next and you can run from any computer given that you install the programs.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.350
Now Canada Next comes in with backdoor factory installed.

07:04.350 --> 07:09.120
So if you learned this on your Android you can actually perform it using another Linux machine.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.860
You can do the exact same attack

07:14.210 --> 07:14.700
OK.

07:14.790 --> 07:19.680
Now this place is working and we're going to do the exact same commands that we did when we were trying

07:19.680 --> 07:23.890
to use multi handler on the Linux and the previous videos.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.430
Except we're just typing them here and Android.

07:26.430 --> 07:30.470
So I'm already in multi-hundred But I type the command for you so you know what to do.

07:30.690 --> 07:38.050
So it's use the exploit more to learn than you set your.

07:38.060 --> 07:43.710
No to Windows.

07:43.950 --> 07:51.670
Peter rivers if you don't make make sure you have the same payload and the configuration files that

07:51.670 --> 07:52.780
we saw before.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.780
Now I'm just going to show options because they have all the options right.

07:55.780 --> 08:02.170
I think now if you want to change an option you just do it the same way that we did it before so they

08:02.170 --> 08:05.020
just do said you put the option name and the value.

08:05.020 --> 08:10.960
So if you want to for example change the host you just do set host and then you put the IP you know

08:10.990 --> 08:13.360
everything is right for me right here.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.030
So it's the exact same way we explained it before.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.010
So I'm just going to leave it.

08:18.200 --> 08:25.620
I'm going to do exploit and this is listening on the port so everything's perfect right now and I have

08:25.620 --> 08:27.410
my backdoor factory running here.

08:27.570 --> 08:32.240
So and I've already redirected any requests to port from Port 80 to 88.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.140
You are back there factor is running.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.520
So everything is perfect.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.480
We are only to do one step which is becoming the man in the middle.

08:40.680 --> 08:46.460
So you have the degree of choice to choose where how you want to be the man in the middle you can do

08:46.460 --> 08:46.620
it.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.760
Why make a fake access point to use in a manner you can do.

08:50.760 --> 08:57.510
Are people listening you can do a hazy idea about us we attack.

08:57.580 --> 09:05.210
For me I'm going to do IRP poisoning using Zanti because it's the easiest way so I'm going to go back

09:05.210 --> 09:07.130
and I'm going to search for laptops

09:12.040 --> 09:14.670
and I can see my device here the windows.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.910
It's called zoos.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.580
So I'm going to tap on it.

09:18.430 --> 09:23.830
I'm going to go to mine in the middle like we did before and as you can see all the options are off.

09:23.830 --> 09:29.120
I just want to point and redirect the flow packets through my device.

09:29.210 --> 09:34.400
So now everything is perfect and I'm just going to go again through a quick review of what we are doing

09:35.000 --> 09:36.920
ARPU poisoning our target.

09:37.070 --> 09:42.260
So we're fooling the target machine to send any packet to our device instead of the router.

09:42.410 --> 09:48.680
Once the packets come to our device we're redirecting them from Port 80 to 88 to use an IP tables on

09:48.680 --> 09:49.530
AT&amp;T.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.730
We have another factor you work in.

09:51.830 --> 09:57.140
So it's going to detect if there is any excuse woes if there is it's going to ask us to if we want to

09:57.140 --> 10:02.960
backdoor it if we say yes the executable is going to be backdoor and then the person can download it

10:03.170 --> 10:08.300
when they downloaded the executable was going to work exactly like expected but at the same time it's

10:08.300 --> 10:16.300
going to run our backdoor which will try to connect back to us on Meet us both using the reverse handler.

10:16.310 --> 10:24.800
So I'm here on my target machine and I'm going to go to 7c website and I'm going to go to the download

10:24.800 --> 10:34.010
page and I'm going to try to download Sivan's for my computer and when I do that I'm going to go back

10:34.010 --> 10:39.570
to my college machine and I'm here at the window where you can download.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.860
We're back to our factories working.

10:42.050 --> 10:47.900
And as you can see it's it's the second that the person is trying to download an executable and it usually

10:47.900 --> 10:49.180
shows you caves.

10:49.310 --> 10:57.590
Caves are gaps in the executable that we can inject our backdoor and now in this particular area we

10:57.590 --> 11:04.080
don't have a free cave that is enough for our acts for our backdoor or for our payload.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.960
So we have two options we can use jumping.

11:07.130 --> 11:15.530
So it's going to use smaller gaps and divide the payload into small small parts or you can just append

11:15.530 --> 11:18.090
it or added to the end of the file.

11:18.290 --> 11:24.760
So I'm going to choose to append and it's going to inject the back door as you can see expansion.

11:24.800 --> 11:31.970
The back door with the executable and it's offering it to the person now as you can see the person is

11:31.970 --> 11:33.970
being offered to download seven zip.

11:34.220 --> 11:38.150
So I'm going to click on Save and that has downloaded it for me.

11:38.150 --> 11:41.410
So I'm just going to show it in folders before I run it.

11:42.300 --> 11:46.400
And as you can see before seven zip did not have the icon of seven zip.

11:46.620 --> 11:49.150
When we when we replaced it with a backdoor.

11:49.290 --> 11:52.960
And now when I run it it's going to run the back door and seven zip.

11:52.950 --> 11:56.740
So the person will be actually able to install 7 0 on their device.

11:59.230 --> 12:04.460
I'm going to say Ron So as you can see it's actually trying to run 7 0.

12:04.480 --> 12:09.140
I'm going to say your trusted and this will install it for me.

12:09.190 --> 12:15.130
Now if I go back here and I'm going to go to my YOU MEET US voice what I'm listening for connections

12:16.900 --> 12:24.040
and as you can see that I've got an interpreter session open 2 1 9 2 1 6 8 1:17 which is me and it's

12:24.040 --> 12:26.270
coming from and 94.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.380
So I can do a quick system info to confirm

12:32.040 --> 12:40.730
as you can see it's the device that we're targeting it's use Windows 8 x 64.

12:40.760 --> 12:46.760
So this was just another scenario that shows you how we can combine the things that we learned so far

12:47.030 --> 12:49.450
in order to run very powerful attacks.
