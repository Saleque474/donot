1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,500
This is my favorite part of the course which is the exploitation part so in this section we're going

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,560
to talk about a tax that will basically give us full access to the target computer so we will be able

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,300
to do anything that we want to the target computer just like what the user can do with their own computer.

4
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,880
We're actually going to use some of the attacks that we learned before combining them with other tasks

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,030
to do this and some scenarios and some scenarios will be do and just a full I thought.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,720
We haven't seen before.

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,200
We're going to talk about how we can bypass plug ins so we for example if you see a locked computer

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,690
or a shut down computer whether it's Windows or Mac OS X we'll see how we can actually log into that

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,750
computer even if it uses a password without using a password.

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,260
So we're going to be able to do this only by Konev by physically connecting our Android device to that

11
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,930
computer via you speak and then we'll be able to log in to that computer even if it's used using a really

12
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,070
powerful password and it doesn't matter whether it's on Windows or OS X.

13
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,160
We're also going to see a number of keyboard attacks and number of scripts that allow us to gain full

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,320
access to Windows computers OSS X and Linux computers so we're going to be attacking all our brain systems

15
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,450
and we're going to see how we can gain full access to these systems using our U.S. v cable.

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,650
So basically as soon as you connect your USP cable to our computer you're going to get full access to

17
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,010
it whether it's Linux Windows or us x.

18
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:46,150
We'll also see how you can do this without even without any physical interaction with Italian computer

19
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,500
using the VDM proxy which will basically backdoor any file that is being downloaded by the target's

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,170
person.

21
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,140
We're going to see how we can backdoor that file on the fly.

22
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,460
And once the person runs that file We're going to get full access to their computer.

23
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,400
So you're not even going to need to say anything or enter into interact with the target person you're

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,310
just going to wait for them to download the file once they download any kind of file any executable.

25
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,020
Basically we're going to backdoor it on the fly when they're on their file is going to run.

26
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,560
So they want me suspicious and at the same time our backdoor is going to run and we're going to gain

27
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,270
full access to their computer.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,020
We'll also going to see what things we can do after we get that access.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,500
So I'm going to give you a quick look on how to use the interpreter shell and how you can drop to a

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,910
Windows shell and all that stuff.

31
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,160
So stay tuned.
