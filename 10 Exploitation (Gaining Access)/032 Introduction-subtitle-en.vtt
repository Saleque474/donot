00:02.760 --> 00:09.500
This is my favorite part of the course which is the exploitation part so in this section we're going

00:09.500 --> 00:15.560
to talk about a tax that will basically give us full access to the target computer so we will be able

00:15.560 --> 00:22.300
to do anything that we want to the target computer just like what the user can do with their own computer.

00:24.370 --> 00:28.880
We're actually going to use some of the attacks that we learned before combining them with other tasks

00:29.220 --> 00:35.030
to do this and some scenarios and some scenarios will be do and just a full I thought.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.720
We haven't seen before.

00:38.140 --> 00:44.200
We're going to talk about how we can bypass plug ins so we for example if you see a locked computer

00:44.200 --> 00:49.690
or a shut down computer whether it's Windows or Mac OS X we'll see how we can actually log into that

00:49.690 --> 00:53.750
computer even if it uses a password without using a password.

00:53.950 --> 00:59.260
So we're going to be able to do this only by Konev by physically connecting our Android device to that

00:59.260 --> 01:04.930
computer via you speak and then we'll be able to log in to that computer even if it's used using a really

01:04.930 --> 01:11.070
powerful password and it doesn't matter whether it's on Windows or OS X.

01:11.140 --> 01:18.160
We're also going to see a number of keyboard attacks and number of scripts that allow us to gain full

01:18.160 --> 01:24.320
access to Windows computers OSS X and Linux computers so we're going to be attacking all our brain systems

01:24.610 --> 01:29.450
and we're going to see how we can gain full access to these systems using our U.S. v cable.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.650
So basically as soon as you connect your USP cable to our computer you're going to get full access to

01:35.650 --> 01:40.010
it whether it's Linux Windows or us x.

01:40.210 --> 01:46.150
We'll also see how you can do this without even without any physical interaction with Italian computer

01:46.420 --> 01:53.500
using the VDM proxy which will basically backdoor any file that is being downloaded by the target's

01:53.500 --> 01:54.170
person.

01:54.220 --> 01:57.140
We're going to see how we can backdoor that file on the fly.

01:57.370 --> 02:01.460
And once the person runs that file We're going to get full access to their computer.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.400
So you're not even going to need to say anything or enter into interact with the target person you're

02:06.400 --> 02:12.310
just going to wait for them to download the file once they download any kind of file any executable.

02:12.310 --> 02:17.020
Basically we're going to backdoor it on the fly when they're on their file is going to run.

02:17.050 --> 02:21.560
So they want me suspicious and at the same time our backdoor is going to run and we're going to gain

02:21.580 --> 02:23.270
full access to their computer.

02:24.960 --> 02:29.020
We'll also going to see what things we can do after we get that access.

02:29.040 --> 02:34.500
So I'm going to give you a quick look on how to use the interpreter shell and how you can drop to a

02:34.500 --> 02:36.910
Windows shell and all that stuff.

02:36.930 --> 02:38.160
So stay tuned.
