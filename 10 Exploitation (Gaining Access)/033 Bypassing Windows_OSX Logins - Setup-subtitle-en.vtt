00:02.140 --> 00:09.190
Today we'll be talking about a really cool and useful attack that we can use in our Android device.

00:09.220 --> 00:15.410
We're going to see how we can bypass logon screens whether it's Windows or OS X logons.

00:15.430 --> 00:21.450
So you're definitely in when you're doing a contest on a network or a company.

00:21.690 --> 00:28.080
You'll end up in many situations you will have access to computers but a lot of these computers will

00:28.080 --> 00:30.870
be off or they'll be on their logon screen.

00:30.870 --> 00:35.650
So they'll people they'll be assigned out or they lock their computers when they are away.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.550
So this feature is actually really useful.

00:38.580 --> 00:43.700
It will allow you to log into any computer whether it runs Windows or OS X.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.160
Without knowing the password.

00:46.230 --> 00:49.280
It will not modify the password of the existing user.

00:49.410 --> 00:54.840
So when the user comes back they will be able to log in again with their usual password so they will

00:54.840 --> 01:01.760
not know that someone modified their computer or modified their password.

01:01.870 --> 01:09.790
We're going to be using a tool called Con boot can boot can be installed on any USP device or any bootable

01:09.790 --> 01:11.370
device you can install it on.

01:11.530 --> 01:16.750
But in this course because we are talking about penetration testing using your Android device we're

01:16.750 --> 01:21.580
going to see how we can install it on your Android device so we can actually install this on any Android

01:21.580 --> 01:21.940
device.

01:21.940 --> 01:28.720
Doesn't have to be and that Hunter device all they need is an app called Drive Droid which you can download

01:28.720 --> 01:34.060
from the App Store and can boot and download it from their official website.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.600
The only problem is conduit is not a free tool.

01:36.610 --> 01:40.910
It actually costs you $25 to buy.

01:41.100 --> 01:47.440
So we're going to see how we can set up the tool now on your Android device and in the next video we're

01:47.480 --> 01:53.700
connected to our target computer and see how we'll be able to log in without knowing the password

01:56.490 --> 02:00.280
so I've bought the tool myself and I have it installed.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.340
I have the file.

02:01.390 --> 02:08.600
Also when you don't when you buy the tool you get this file which is the cone boot and saltation file.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.140
It actually allows you to install it.

02:10.130 --> 02:17.570
It comes in with an Iraqi that allows you to install it on a USP device or on an ISO image on a CD.

02:17.730 --> 02:23.040
But for now I'm actually going to run it in order to run the cxi you can run it from Windows just double

02:23.040 --> 02:28.230
click it and if you're running it on with Linux you need a program called wine.

02:28.290 --> 02:36.160
So I'm just going to click it here he'll see a normal Windows installation and I'm just going to extract

02:36.160 --> 02:37.240
it here.

02:37.450 --> 02:42.950
So it's in home zoo's downloads convoyed.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.290
And as you can see I have the files here.

02:47.770 --> 02:55.290
And you can actually use the can boot installer to install it on a USP as I said so here you can start

02:55.290 --> 02:55.670
on here.

02:55.710 --> 03:00.630
We are on the CD but I'm not going to be doing that because as I said we're going to be using it on

03:00.630 --> 03:02.310
our Android device.

03:02.310 --> 03:06.460
So I'm going to navigate into cone with USP files.

03:06.570 --> 03:12.790
I'm going to go on use your files here and the file that you want to be using is the can would do it.

03:12.790 --> 03:13.450
I m g.

03:13.470 --> 03:14.570
So is this file.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.920
It's only 1.5 megabytes.

03:20.840 --> 03:28.830
And you can easily send it to your Android phone or you can send this via email by droid by any program

03:28.830 --> 03:29.600
that you want to use.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.050
Just make sure you actually send it to your Android device.

03:33.050 --> 03:38.930
So I sent it actually via e-mail because it's just really easy and I'll show you here how to set it

03:38.930 --> 03:40.570
up on your Android device.

03:42.050 --> 03:45.970
So I'm going to go on the app that I told you you can download from the Apple store.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.230
Again you don't need that Hunter for this.

03:48.230 --> 03:52.690
You can do it on any Android device that runs drive droid.

03:52.730 --> 03:59.890
So I'm going to tap on Dr droite and I'm going to click on the flaws to add an image and I'm going to

03:59.890 --> 04:07.520
say that I'm going to do it from a file because I downloaded it I'm going to call it Khond boots.

04:09.330 --> 04:18.170
And I'm going to click on the this icon and I'm going to go on my file explorer and pick this as you

04:18.170 --> 04:19.340
can see that I have it here.

04:19.350 --> 04:20.230
Can do it.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.230
I am.

04:21.710 --> 04:26.400
So I'm going to tap it there and I'm going to pick the first option.

04:27.490 --> 04:29.910
And just waits for a gun to save it.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.000
And that's it.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.750
Now I have conduits in here.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.510
So all you have to do now whenever.

04:37.520 --> 04:44.600
So don't do this all the time whenever you want to log into a computer that does not have that you don't

04:44.600 --> 04:47.330
have the passwords for that has a log and screen.

04:47.330 --> 04:53.190
All you have to do is Topcon good and select the way that you want to do it.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.970
And I'm going to select three on the here.

04:56.180 --> 05:00.800
So I'm top in that and as you can see it's saying host Hostin image on your screen.

05:00.830 --> 05:09.430
If you go on the notifications you can see that it's telling me that it's just an my conduit image.

05:09.460 --> 05:13.120
So now my Android device is hosting the image.

05:13.120 --> 05:18.750
And as soon as I connected to any laptop it's locked as a USP device with this image.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.130
So we can boot from it.

05:20.440 --> 05:25.890
So in the next video I'll show you I have a Windows computer with a logon with a password.

05:25.990 --> 05:31.930
I'm going to connect it connects my Android device to it and boot from the Android device and we'll

05:31.930 --> 05:35.720
see how we'll be able to log in to the computer without a password.
