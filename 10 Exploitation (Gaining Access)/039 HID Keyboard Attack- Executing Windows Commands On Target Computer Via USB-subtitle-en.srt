1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:08,090
Today we're going to talk about another exploitation method that we can do use that Hunter before we

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,820
were able to fool a computer when we connected with use and you asked me and we told the computer that

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,610
we are a network device.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,370
When we did this we force all the traffic through our network device which allowed us to read all the

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,560
packets intercept them and modify them or do whatever that we want to do as a man in the middle.

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,480
We did that in the U.S. we attack.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,020
Now today we're going to do hate I.D. keyboard attack.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,600
So in this attack we're going to fool the computer and tell tell that computer that we are a keyboard

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,540
instead of it that we are a network device.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,460
When we do that as we will be able to sense physical keystrokes to that computer as well.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,800
There won't be physical but we're going to program our Android device to send keystrokes to that computer

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,960
but they will appear as if they're being typed physically.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,780
This will allow us to bypass the auto run feature and who will allow us to do run any command that we

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,640
want to run on the target machine.

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,670
So we can't run any Windows commands.

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,470
We can gain full access to that computer we'll see that and the next video or you can just add a username

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,740
and password and then remotely log into that computer which is what we're going to do in this video.

18
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,110
So we're going to program our Android device.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,980
As I said we're going to add commands so we're going to use to command the first command is to add a

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,890
user.

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,630
And the second command is to add that user to the administrators.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,760
So let's go ahead and first before I actually execute the attack I want to show you some of the configurations

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,710
that you need to do first so that the attack works successfully.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,920
So the first thing you want to do is go to an app called USV keyboard.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,890
Now this comes in pre-installed with Kaleena next.

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,520
And when you run it for the first time it's going to ask you to install the kernel.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,940
So say yes it's going to install it automatically for you.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,030
Now here I don't need to do that because I've already done it before.

29
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm not asking me to do it.

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:13,570
Now once you do that go back to settings and go to developer options.

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,110
And make sure that you be debugging is enabled.

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,260
And as you can see I have it enabled here.

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:30,110
Then go to storage and click on these three little dots and go and make sure that MPP is enabled.

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,490
Now once you have these two things enable you to go and we can start the attack.

35
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:44,730
So I'm going to launch Kalli menu and I'm going to navigate through the keyboard the thuck and this

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,880
is the first flight is what allows you to gain full access to the target computer and hack it.

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,020
So I'm going to leave that for the next video and I'm going to go to the windows and the option.

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,000
So here you put the commands that you want to run on the target machine.

39
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,740
And as you can see that I have to come are surrounded.

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,360
Now these are Windows commands.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,030
You can run them through the terminal you can add any command that you want here.

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,140
And it's a run.

43
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:17,150
So if you actually do this command on Windows it'll either use a name on Windows and password as we're

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,850
doing it here.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,050
But we're actually going to program our computer and then can our device and then connect it to the

46
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,650
computer and these commands will be executed automatically.

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:41,400
So I'm just going to change the user name here to.

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,530
Now if you're doing penetration testing you probably want to use a different name

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,610
so and the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,810
So that's all good.

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,920
We're going to do updates and lots of data.

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,510
So everything is perfect.

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,660
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go.

54
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:08,250
I'll show you here my Windows device right here and I'm going to connect my Nexus device to this machine

55
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,580
using you and me.

56
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,550
So now my device is connected and I'm going to go on my hunter machine right here and I'm going to click

57
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,050
on these little three dots and hit execute.

58
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,110
Attack get to go back quickly to my Windows machine and as you can see that these commands are actually

59
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,210
now being executed automatically.

60
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:35,350
So I'm not physically typing these commands they're just being around really quickly.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,520
So as you can see that the commands got executed automatically.

62
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,270
I didn't actually use Kamar So the command prompt got opened a Randi to come up so I wanted the net

63
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,010
user zayd.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
And then the addition to the administrators group.

65
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,030
So we actually now have a username and password on a target machine and we achieved this only by connected

66
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,010
our next device to that machine.

67
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,680
So all we can do now is remotely logging into that machine using the remote desktop.

68
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,240
So I downloaded the Microsoft remote desktop from the plaister

69
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,810
Well you actually need to sign up sign out to this account first.

70
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,200
So I'm going to sign out

71
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,840
and then enter here I'm going to add a new device.

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,310
I'm going to say it's a desktop and then I'm going to put the IP address

73
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:41,300
which is 1 9 2 6 a.

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,380
I'm going to save up the device going to try to connect.

75
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,230
Now you can do this from any device.

76
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,010
You can do this from one to the next device or macrolides or Windows and other Windows device.

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,440
Well we're just doing it from Android because we're teaching penetration testing from Android devices.

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,180
So it's going to ask you if you trust that computer I'm going to say yes no problem connect to.

79
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,380
So the user name is Zayde

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,010
that password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.

81
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,360
Connect.

82
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Now as you can see trying to plug me in as a

83
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,930
so I have full access to the Windows machine remotely access use the remote desktop using the username

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,020
that we did.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,800
So basically this attack allows you to run any Windows command that you can preprogram And once you

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,210
connect your device to a Windows or to a device used in U.S. be these attacks will automatically run

87
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,150
as if they're physically being typed on a keyboard.
