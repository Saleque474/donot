00:01.430 --> 00:08.090
Today we're going to talk about another exploitation method that we can do use that Hunter before we

00:08.090 --> 00:13.820
were able to fool a computer when we connected with use and you asked me and we told the computer that

00:13.820 --> 00:16.610
we are a network device.

00:16.610 --> 00:22.370
When we did this we force all the traffic through our network device which allowed us to read all the

00:22.370 --> 00:28.560
packets intercept them and modify them or do whatever that we want to do as a man in the middle.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.480
We did that in the U.S. we attack.

00:31.550 --> 00:35.020
Now today we're going to do hate I.D. keyboard attack.

00:35.360 --> 00:41.600
So in this attack we're going to fool the computer and tell tell that computer that we are a keyboard

00:41.630 --> 00:44.540
instead of it that we are a network device.

00:44.720 --> 00:51.460
When we do that as we will be able to sense physical keystrokes to that computer as well.

00:51.470 --> 00:57.800
There won't be physical but we're going to program our Android device to send keystrokes to that computer

00:57.810 --> 01:00.960
but they will appear as if they're being typed physically.

01:00.960 --> 01:06.780
This will allow us to bypass the auto run feature and who will allow us to do run any command that we

01:06.780 --> 01:08.640
want to run on the target machine.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.670
So we can't run any Windows commands.

01:10.860 --> 01:16.470
We can gain full access to that computer we'll see that and the next video or you can just add a username

01:16.470 --> 01:22.740
and password and then remotely log into that computer which is what we're going to do in this video.

01:22.810 --> 01:25.110
So we're going to program our Android device.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.980
As I said we're going to add commands so we're going to use to command the first command is to add a

01:29.980 --> 01:30.890
user.

01:31.150 --> 01:36.630
And the second command is to add that user to the administrators.

01:36.640 --> 01:42.760
So let's go ahead and first before I actually execute the attack I want to show you some of the configurations

01:42.760 --> 01:46.710
that you need to do first so that the attack works successfully.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.920
So the first thing you want to do is go to an app called USV keyboard.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.890
Now this comes in pre-installed with Kaleena next.

01:53.950 --> 01:57.520
And when you run it for the first time it's going to ask you to install the kernel.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.940
So say yes it's going to install it automatically for you.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.030
Now here I don't need to do that because I've already done it before.

02:04.030 --> 02:05.560
I'm not asking me to do it.

02:06.730 --> 02:13.570
Now once you do that go back to settings and go to developer options.

02:15.220 --> 02:18.110
And make sure that you be debugging is enabled.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.260
And as you can see I have it enabled here.

02:20.260 --> 02:30.110
Then go to storage and click on these three little dots and go and make sure that MPP is enabled.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.490
Now once you have these two things enable you to go and we can start the attack.

02:35.670 --> 02:44.730
So I'm going to launch Kalli menu and I'm going to navigate through the keyboard the thuck and this

02:44.730 --> 02:49.880
is the first flight is what allows you to gain full access to the target computer and hack it.

02:49.950 --> 02:55.020
So I'm going to leave that for the next video and I'm going to go to the windows and the option.

02:55.050 --> 02:59.000
So here you put the commands that you want to run on the target machine.

03:00.190 --> 03:02.740
And as you can see that I have to come are surrounded.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.360
Now these are Windows commands.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.030
You can run them through the terminal you can add any command that you want here.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.140
And it's a run.

03:11.270 --> 03:17.150
So if you actually do this command on Windows it'll either use a name on Windows and password as we're

03:17.150 --> 03:17.850
doing it here.

03:18.040 --> 03:24.050
But we're actually going to program our computer and then can our device and then connect it to the

03:24.050 --> 03:28.650
computer and these commands will be executed automatically.

03:28.660 --> 03:41.400
So I'm just going to change the user name here to.

03:41.620 --> 03:45.530
Now if you're doing penetration testing you probably want to use a different name

03:49.800 --> 03:53.610
so and the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.810
So that's all good.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.920
We're going to do updates and lots of data.

03:56.940 --> 03:58.510
So everything is perfect.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.660
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go.

04:00.660 --> 04:08.250
I'll show you here my Windows device right here and I'm going to connect my Nexus device to this machine

04:08.540 --> 04:09.580
using you and me.

04:10.920 --> 04:17.550
So now my device is connected and I'm going to go on my hunter machine right here and I'm going to click

04:17.550 --> 04:20.050
on these little three dots and hit execute.

04:20.070 --> 04:26.110
Attack get to go back quickly to my Windows machine and as you can see that these commands are actually

04:26.110 --> 04:28.210
now being executed automatically.

04:28.390 --> 04:35.350
So I'm not physically typing these commands they're just being around really quickly.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.520
So as you can see that the commands got executed automatically.

04:39.660 --> 04:45.270
I didn't actually use Kamar So the command prompt got opened a Randi to come up so I wanted the net

04:45.270 --> 04:47.010
user zayd.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.800
And then the addition to the administrators group.

04:50.820 --> 04:56.030
So we actually now have a username and password on a target machine and we achieved this only by connected

04:56.070 --> 04:58.010
our next device to that machine.

04:59.220 --> 05:04.680
So all we can do now is remotely logging into that machine using the remote desktop.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.240
So I downloaded the Microsoft remote desktop from the plaister

05:12.580 --> 05:15.810
Well you actually need to sign up sign out to this account first.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.200
So I'm going to sign out

05:24.210 --> 05:26.840
and then enter here I'm going to add a new device.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.310
I'm going to say it's a desktop and then I'm going to put the IP address

05:34.330 --> 05:41.300
which is 1 9 2 6 a.

05:41.400 --> 05:48.380
I'm going to save up the device going to try to connect.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.230
Now you can do this from any device.

05:50.310 --> 05:55.010
You can do this from one to the next device or macrolides or Windows and other Windows device.

05:55.020 --> 05:59.440
Well we're just doing it from Android because we're teaching penetration testing from Android devices.

06:01.520 --> 06:06.180
So it's going to ask you if you trust that computer I'm going to say yes no problem connect to.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.380
So the user name is Zayde

06:18.280 --> 06:24.010
that password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.

06:24.210 --> 06:29.360
Connect.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.160
Now as you can see trying to plug me in as a

06:36.070 --> 06:42.930
so I have full access to the Windows machine remotely access use the remote desktop using the username

06:43.000 --> 06:44.020
that we did.

06:44.320 --> 06:50.800
So basically this attack allows you to run any Windows command that you can preprogram And once you

06:50.800 --> 06:58.210
connect your device to a Windows or to a device used in U.S. be these attacks will automatically run

06:58.450 --> 07:01.150
as if they're physically being typed on a keyboard.
