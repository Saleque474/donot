00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:09,190
Today we'll be talking about a really cool and useful attack that we can use in our Android device.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:15,410
We're going to see how we can bypass logon screens whether it's Windows or OS X logons.

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:21,450
So you're definitely in when you're doing a contest on a network or a company.

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,080
You'll end up in many situations you will have access to computers but a lot of these computers will

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,870
be off or they'll be on their logon screen.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,650
So they'll people they'll be assigned out or they lock their computers when they are away.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,550
So this feature is actually really useful.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,700
It will allow you to log into any computer whether it runs Windows or OS X.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,160
Without knowing the password.

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,280
It will not modify the password of the existing user.

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,840
So when the user comes back they will be able to log in again with their usual password so they will

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,760
not know that someone modified their computer or modified their password.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:09,790
We're going to be using a tool called Con boot can boot can be installed on any USP device or any bootable

14
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,370
device you can install it on.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,750
But in this course because we are talking about penetration testing using your Android device we're

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,580
going to see how we can install it on your Android device so we can actually install this on any Android

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:21,940
device.

18
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:28,720
Doesn't have to be and that Hunter device all they need is an app called Drive Droid which you can download

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,060
from the App Store and can boot and download it from their official website.

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,600
The only problem is conduit is not a free tool.

21
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,910
It actually costs you $25 to buy.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,440
So we're going to see how we can set up the tool now on your Android device and in the next video we're

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,700
connected to our target computer and see how we'll be able to log in without knowing the password

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,280
so I've bought the tool myself and I have it installed.

25
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,340
I have the file.

26
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,600
Also when you don't when you buy the tool you get this file which is the cone boot and saltation file.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,140
It actually allows you to install it.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:17,570
It comes in with an Iraqi that allows you to install it on a USP device or on an ISO image on a CD.

29
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,040
But for now I'm actually going to run it in order to run the cxi you can run it from Windows just double

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,230
click it and if you're running it on with Linux you need a program called wine.

31
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:36,160
So I'm just going to click it here he'll see a normal Windows installation and I'm just going to extract

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,240
it here.

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,950
So it's in home zoo's downloads convoyed.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,290
And as you can see I have the files here.

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:55,290
And you can actually use the can boot installer to install it on a USP as I said so here you can start

36
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:55,670
on here.

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,630
We are on the CD but I'm not going to be doing that because as I said we're going to be using it on

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,310
our Android device.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,460
So I'm going to navigate into cone with USP files.

40
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,790
I'm going to go on use your files here and the file that you want to be using is the can would do it.

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,450
I m g.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,570
So is this file.

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,920
It's only 1.5 megabytes.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,830
And you can easily send it to your Android phone or you can send this via email by droid by any program

45
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,600
that you want to use.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,050
Just make sure you actually send it to your Android device.

47
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,930
So I sent it actually via e-mail because it's just really easy and I'll show you here how to set it

48
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,570
up on your Android device.

49
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,970
So I'm going to go on the app that I told you you can download from the Apple store.

50
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,230
Again you don't need that Hunter for this.

51
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,690
You can do it on any Android device that runs drive droid.

52
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:59,890
So I'm going to tap on Dr droite and I'm going to click on the flaws to add an image and I'm going to

53
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:07,520
say that I'm going to do it from a file because I downloaded it I'm going to call it Khond boots.

54
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:18,170
And I'm going to click on the this icon and I'm going to go on my file explorer and pick this as you

55
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,340
can see that I have it here.

56
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,230
Can do it.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,230
I am.

58
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,400
So I'm going to tap it there and I'm going to pick the first option.

59
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,910
And just waits for a gun to save it.

60
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,000
And that's it.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,750
Now I have conduits in here.

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,510
So all you have to do now whenever.

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,600
So don't do this all the time whenever you want to log into a computer that does not have that you don't

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,330
have the passwords for that has a log and screen.

65
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:53,190
All you have to do is Topcon good and select the way that you want to do it.

66
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,970
And I'm going to select three on the here.

67
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,800
So I'm top in that and as you can see it's saying host Hostin image on your screen.

68
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:09,430
If you go on the notifications you can see that it's telling me that it's just an my conduit image.

69
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,120
So now my Android device is hosting the image.

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,750
And as soon as I connected to any laptop it's locked as a USP device with this image.

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,130
So we can boot from it.

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,890
So in the next video I'll show you I have a Windows computer with a logon with a password.

73
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,930
I'm going to connect it connects my Android device to it and boot from the Android device and we'll

74
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,720
see how we'll be able to log in to the computer without a password.
