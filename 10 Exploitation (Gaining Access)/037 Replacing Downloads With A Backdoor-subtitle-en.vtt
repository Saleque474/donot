WEBVTT

00:03.030 --> 00:08.580
So now though we know how to create a backdoor and how we can listen for connections coming from that

00:08.910 --> 00:09.850
backdoor.

00:10.110 --> 00:18.180
Today we're going to combine all number of things that we learn before in order to launch a powerful

00:18.180 --> 00:18.870
attack.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.570
So we're going to do is we're going to do a fake download attack.

00:23.620 --> 00:32.330
So basically the target person so some person and it that we are connected to is going to download and.

00:32.920 --> 00:41.560
We're going to replace this with our backdoor so that the person once he tries to run the XP that he

00:41.560 --> 00:47.980
downloaded he will actually run our backdoor and instead of the programs that they think they downloaded.

00:48.250 --> 00:51.590
So we're now going to need to physically connect to their computer.

00:51.610 --> 00:55.160
We're not going to need to fool them or send them anything or tell them all.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.990
Download this up or download this thing.

00:57.130 --> 01:01.960
They're willingly going to download say a program that they want to download as their downloads and

01:01.960 --> 01:03.860
it's will going to be the man in the middle.

01:04.060 --> 01:08.490
So we're going to do A.R.T. poison ink like we learned before using Zanti.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.820
We're going to replace the file that they're downloaded with our backdoor.

01:11.970 --> 01:15.600
And then when they run the file We're going to get.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.820
We'll Very get full access to their tablet computer.

01:19.170 --> 01:25.350
We actually did this whole attack scenario when we were talking about Zanti but instead of replacing

01:25.350 --> 01:30.510
the downloaded file with the backdoor we actually replaced it with a calculator.

01:30.570 --> 01:37.110
And when I ran it on the target machine the person ran a calculator instead of the program that they

01:37.110 --> 01:37.890
downloaded.

01:37.890 --> 01:42.430
Now that wasn't really useful like to place a program with a calculator for you replace it with a back

01:42.430 --> 01:42.870
door.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.100
It's much more useful because we're going to gain full access to the target computer.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.700
So what we're going to do is we've already done the first two steps.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.780
We have our backdoor.

01:52.780 --> 01:58.690
And I've sent it to my the Tanter device and it's there now and listen on connections and I'm already

01:58.690 --> 02:00.910
listening on connections here.

02:00.910 --> 02:07.710
So I'm just going to do exploits and I'm listening on my back there that was created in the previous

02:07.710 --> 02:08.420
video.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.260
So now all we're going to do is I'm going to become the man in the middle then I'm going to launch the

02:13.260 --> 02:17.370
interception feature to intercept the downloaded files.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.550
So let's go to our next Hunter device.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.750
I'm going to go on Zanti

02:29.130 --> 02:35.240
and I'm going to go on my target device and that is my Windows device right here so it's 1 9 2 6 8 0

02:35.250 --> 02:40.420
11 that I'm going to go on man in the middle.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.350
We did all of this before so it's the exact same steps.

02:43.450 --> 02:48.690
The only difference is that we're going to use our backdoor in this case.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.350
Now I'm going to go on the interceptor.

02:50.410 --> 02:53.590
I'm going to I click on this gear icon

02:56.610 --> 03:06.300
then I'm going to make sure that the extension right here is selected as Yves and my file is selected

03:06.300 --> 03:08.850
so I'm going to go on them next file.

03:09.050 --> 03:12.410
I'm going to go use an S file explorer.

03:12.740 --> 03:19.430
I'm going to select my backdoor right here so backdoor that you actually select the first method

03:22.240 --> 03:23.200
now everything is done.

03:23.200 --> 03:29.370
So all I'm going to do is I'm going to enable my interceptor option by typing on the up and now it's

03:29.380 --> 03:30.310
on.

03:30.470 --> 03:37.480
And now I'm going to tap on the on self-pride to enable the man in the middle attack which will basically

03:37.930 --> 03:39.950
put me in the middle of the connection.

03:40.920 --> 03:47.720
And so now that every time that the target person tries to download any XP it will be replaced by the

03:47.720 --> 03:51.790
X-C that we selected in our intercept download option.

03:51.840 --> 03:57.210
So let's go to our windows machine and try to download something and see what happens.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.820
So that's go to be dot.com

04:03.710 --> 04:09.430
then let's say I'm going to search for seven zip.

04:09.610 --> 04:16.070
Then the person is going to go to their downloads page try to download the latest version of Sony's

04:17.310 --> 04:18.820
going to say save it.

04:18.840 --> 04:24.290
Now remember that the backdoor that we created is actually undetectable by antivirus.

04:24.690 --> 04:29.610
So as you can see now it's downloaded 7 0 1 5 0 5.

04:29.610 --> 04:32.780
The only suspicious thing is that you see there is no icon on it.

04:32.970 --> 04:37.480
It's not going to be detectable by antivirus is.

04:37.580 --> 04:40.940
And when you're on it the Windows will tell you that it has an unknown publisher

04:43.800 --> 04:45.810
wants its Ron.

04:45.930 --> 04:50.170
It's not going to run the actual unzip it's going to on our backdoor.

04:50.190 --> 04:55.410
So this would be a bit suspicious as well when the person is going to double click it as if it's not

04:55.410 --> 04:57.610
going to work the program that they expect to work.

04:57.870 --> 05:04.920
But when you go back here you will see that we got full access and we have therapy session on the target

05:04.920 --> 05:11.970
device so we can do a system for and we'll see that we have access to this Windows 8 machine.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.540
Now as I said there's two suspicious things.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.550
The first thing that has no icon.

05:16.610 --> 05:21.600
The second thing is that when the person double click it their program is not actually going to work.

05:21.710 --> 05:26.420
So they're not going to see their program they might suspect that something went wrong.

05:26.540 --> 05:33.220
Now in the next video we're going to do is we're going to learn how we backdoor these files on the fly.

05:33.250 --> 05:39.640
So once someone tries to download like this we're going to backdoor their program that they're downloading

05:39.940 --> 05:43.160
on the fly and our back door to it all when they run it.

05:43.180 --> 05:44.880
Their program will work.

05:45.010 --> 05:50.090
And our backdoor will work at the same time so that they won't be suspicious that something went wrong.
