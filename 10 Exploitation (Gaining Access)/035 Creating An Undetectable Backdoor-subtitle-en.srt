1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,640
The next few videos we're going to talk about some contacts that you will need to have a backdoor that

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,410
will spawn a shell back to your device.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,410
So I decided to make a video to explain to you how to create a backdoor and how to test this backdoor

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,710
so I'm going to explain it was so that in the future when we do more sophisticated attacks I can skip

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,030
this step because you know how to do it and you know how to test if it works or not.

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,690
So to do this we're actually going to use a tool called Divell evasion.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:46,850
The reason I'm using this tool is because it creates factors that are not detectable by any antivirus.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,970
So when you create a backdoor and this and this tool the antivirus programs will not detect this as

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,600
a threat.

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,490
So in order to solve it all you have to do is just apt get install Bill evasion in your terminal and

11
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,740
Cali the process might take some time.

12
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,570
It's going to download around 600 megabytes of packages.

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,680
Just every time you asked to do something always say YES YES YES YES YES.

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,990
Until the installation is finished.

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,280
So it's very straightforward.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:27,170
Or you have to do is just go here you have to get Misto they'll evey you hit enter and it'll are solved

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,410
for you.

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,980
Now for me it's saying that it's already installed so I don't need to install it.

19
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,530
Now once you have it installed I'm going to run it using the same command.

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:45,460
So Bill evasion going to hit enter and as you can see now I have 45 notes loaded so that's 45 different

21
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,290
types of doctors that I can create.

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:56,530
If you want to list all these payloads and see what you have you can just type in list to see them that's

23
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:03,510
all the payload that you can create so far today is on for the next videos we're going to be use and

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,340
see as Mr. Patel reverse TTP.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,980
So in order to use this you all you have to do is just type in use 8 because that was number 8.

26
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,750
So now has shown me the options that this has.

27
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,410
And you can use this the same way we were use in me just like in the previous videos the same way you

28
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,150
when you want to change an option you type insert option name and then the value that you want to change

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,870
it to.

30
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,060
So you again do this the exact same way.

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,320
So for example to set up our IP Address this is our local IP address.

32
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:45,540
So l host same way that we were doing it with me to exploit all you have to do is type in set host and

33
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,460
put your IP address.

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
So to see our IP address we type in if configure

35
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,690
as you can see that my IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 4.

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,600
So I'm going to put that here now I'm doing this because we're going to do a verse connection.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,280
So the target machine will be the machine that connects back to us.

38
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,870
Now to make sure that the options are right I'm going to type it in full again and we can see that my

39
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,420
IP address is set up here and then we can see the fourth right here so we have to set this up when we

40
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,660
do the multi-hundred like we did in the previous video.

41
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,770
So now everything's done I'm going to type and generate

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,030
and I'm going to type in the name of the file to create So I'm going to call it backdoor.

43
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,800
Now in practice you do you don't want to call your backdoor backdoor.

44
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,800
But for now we're testing so I'm going to call it back door.

45
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,410
And it's created and it's saying it's written to this file.

46
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:55,970
So my backdoor is stored in user share Bill output compiled backdoor to eat now you get the Yangtze

47
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,130
you can send it to any computer once you're on the cxxviii it will try to connect back to your device

48
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,000
on port 80 80 like we set it up.

49
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,760
So how do we listen to that what we're doing.

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,640
We're going to do with the same way we did it when we arrived our first flight option.

51
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,860
So I'm going to run MSF Canso.

52
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,270
I'm going to quit this so I'm going to type in

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,300
that exit and then I'm going to write myself.

54
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,470
So.

55
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:42,340
So the next few steps are going to be exactly the same steps that we did when we did our first flight

56
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,540
option with the idea of what the tag.

57
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,840
So this will basically just allow us to listen on port 80 80 for incoming connections.

58
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,540
So I'm going to use exploits

59
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,410
that I actually don't need to on this come on now because I'm already in it.

60
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,070
Well just to show you how to do it then I'm going to set my payload

61
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,070
to Windows.

62
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:15,160
Same thing or that we chose one we created the payload so it was Windows interpolator reverse a TTP.

63
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:26,090
I said the old fart to 88 like we did it before and I'm going I said my host 2 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 14 the

64
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,900
same values that we set up with the back door.

65
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,870
So now we're just making sure that everything is right and everything is right.

66
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,320
So I'm going to type in exploit and now listen in on connections so know I'm going to do now is I'm

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,970
going to go I'm going to copy this file to my target Windows machine.

68
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,360
Again this is not a practical attack.

69
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,140
I just want to show you how to create a backdoor and how to test this back there so I'm actually going

70
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,720
to send this file to the target machine and run it from the target machine and we'll see if this works

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,030
or not.

72
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,850
So if it works we're going to use it in the future videos to carry out our attacks.

73
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,480
Now I have the file here so I'm going to double click it.

74
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm going to run it.

75
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:23,420
And if we go back here as you can see we got an interpreter session back from this IP which is our target

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,790
IP to our IP.

77
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,690
And if we do this info we will see that we are inside the target machine.

78
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,070
This is actually really useful.

79
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,550
So even without this course or without these things that you're going to learn and this course created

80
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,880
a backdoor is really simple and comes in handy into many many situations.

81
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,960
So using villi can create a backdoor that is not detectable by any anti-virus and it can confirm this

82
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,390
using your own anti-virus but please don't upload it to the websites that test for multiple antivirus

83
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,660
is because they usually analyze the backdoor and then it's a want to be undetectable anymore.

84
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,770
So what it creates them undetectable and there are safe Web sites that you can test with.

85
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,860
I'm going to put them and the resources to test your backdoor with and they're not detectable again

86
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,080
by antivirus is that it works to give you a reverse connection.

87
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,640
And it's really small.

88
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,900
So in the future videos we're going to need to use backorders.

89
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,010
I'm going to skip through this step because we already know how to make them.
