1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,580
So now though we know how to create a backdoor and how we can listen for connections coming from that

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,850
backdoor.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:18,180
Today we're going to combine all number of things that we learn before in order to launch a powerful

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,870
attack.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,570
So we're going to do is we're going to do a fake download attack.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:32,330
So basically the target person so some person and it that we are connected to is going to download and.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:41,560
We're going to replace this with our backdoor so that the person once he tries to run the XP that he

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,980
downloaded he will actually run our backdoor and instead of the programs that they think they downloaded.

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,590
So we're now going to need to physically connect to their computer.

10
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,160
We're not going to need to fool them or send them anything or tell them all.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,990
Download this up or download this thing.

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,960
They're willingly going to download say a program that they want to download as their downloads and

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,860
it's will going to be the man in the middle.

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,490
So we're going to do A.R.T. poison ink like we learned before using Zanti.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,820
We're going to replace the file that they're downloaded with our backdoor.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,600
And then when they run the file We're going to get.

17
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,820
We'll Very get full access to their tablet computer.

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,350
We actually did this whole attack scenario when we were talking about Zanti but instead of replacing

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,510
the downloaded file with the backdoor we actually replaced it with a calculator.

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,110
And when I ran it on the target machine the person ran a calculator instead of the program that they

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,890
downloaded.

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,430
Now that wasn't really useful like to place a program with a calculator for you replace it with a back

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:42,870
door.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,100
It's much more useful because we're going to gain full access to the target computer.

25
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,700
So what we're going to do is we've already done the first two steps.

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,780
We have our backdoor.

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,690
And I've sent it to my the Tanter device and it's there now and listen on connections and I'm already

28
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,910
listening on connections here.

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:07,710
So I'm just going to do exploits and I'm listening on my back there that was created in the previous

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,420
video.

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,260
So now all we're going to do is I'm going to become the man in the middle then I'm going to launch the

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,370
interception feature to intercept the downloaded files.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,550
So let's go to our next Hunter device.

34
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,750
I'm going to go on Zanti

35
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,240
and I'm going to go on my target device and that is my Windows device right here so it's 1 9 2 6 8 0

36
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,420
11 that I'm going to go on man in the middle.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,350
We did all of this before so it's the exact same steps.

38
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,690
The only difference is that we're going to use our backdoor in this case.

39
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,350
Now I'm going to go on the interceptor.

40
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,590
I'm going to I click on this gear icon

41
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:06,300
then I'm going to make sure that the extension right here is selected as Yves and my file is selected

42
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,850
so I'm going to go on them next file.

43
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,410
I'm going to go use an S file explorer.

44
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:19,430
I'm going to select my backdoor right here so backdoor that you actually select the first method

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
now everything is done.

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,370
So all I'm going to do is I'm going to enable my interceptor option by typing on the up and now it's

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,310
on.

48
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:37,480
And now I'm going to tap on the on self-pride to enable the man in the middle attack which will basically

49
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,950
put me in the middle of the connection.

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,720
And so now that every time that the target person tries to download any XP it will be replaced by the

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,790
X-C that we selected in our intercept download option.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,210
So let's go to our windows machine and try to download something and see what happens.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,820
So that's go to be dot.com

54
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,430
then let's say I'm going to search for seven zip.

55
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:16,070
Then the person is going to go to their downloads page try to download the latest version of Sony's

56
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,820
going to say save it.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,290
Now remember that the backdoor that we created is actually undetectable by antivirus.

58
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,610
So as you can see now it's downloaded 7 0 1 5 0 5.

59
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,780
The only suspicious thing is that you see there is no icon on it.

60
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,480
It's not going to be detectable by antivirus is.

61
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,940
And when you're on it the Windows will tell you that it has an unknown publisher

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,810
wants its Ron.

63
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,170
It's not going to run the actual unzip it's going to on our backdoor.

64
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,410
So this would be a bit suspicious as well when the person is going to double click it as if it's not

65
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,610
going to work the program that they expect to work.

66
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,920
But when you go back here you will see that we got full access and we have therapy session on the target

67
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,970
device so we can do a system for and we'll see that we have access to this Windows 8 machine.

68
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,540
Now as I said there's two suspicious things.

69
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,550
The first thing that has no icon.

70
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,600
The second thing is that when the person double click it their program is not actually going to work.

71
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,420
So they're not going to see their program they might suspect that something went wrong.

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,220
Now in the next video we're going to do is we're going to learn how we backdoor these files on the fly.

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,640
So once someone tries to download like this we're going to backdoor their program that they're downloading

74
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,160
on the fly and our back door to it all when they run it.

75
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,880
Their program will work.

76
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,090
And our backdoor will work at the same time so that they won't be suspicious that something went wrong.
