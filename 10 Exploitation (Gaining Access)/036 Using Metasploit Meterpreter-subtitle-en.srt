1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,910
So in the previous video we show how we can gain an interpreter session on the target machine.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,050
And today I'm just going to show you a few things that you could run or do with your own interpreter

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:12,800
session.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,790
Now again as I said before people take full courses in order to learn how to use with us.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,700
Lloyd so far today we're just going to have a quick look and quick hands on the things that you can

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,630
do.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:31,100
Most important thing keep in mind you can always just type in help and it'll show you all the command

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,480
that you can run.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,250
So that's a really helpful thing.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,060
And then you can see what you can do.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,410
So the first thing I'd like to do was something inside the system.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,850
I'd go six ANFO just to get the information of the current system to get to know.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,110
So now we can see that we the computer name is zoos.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,240
It's running Windows 8 x 64 and and the interpreter is 32.

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:01,700
The system language is English you as you can also do an ifconfig to get the interfaces and get their

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,990
IP address and all that.

17
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,860
So we can see that it's used in the US we are less careful.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,480
But we can see the MAC address we can see the IP address.

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,170
So all this is useful depending on what you want to do with the target machine.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,610
Now we can see that we have another interface here that is not connected.

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,230
We have another interface so this is a wired interface.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,440
Again we can see its IP address and its MAC address.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,870
So on other interface right here.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,870
So this is just kind of useful information that we can see of the target machine.

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,510
Also you can do as you can see what's your working directory where are you working right now so we're

26
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,920
in C users and this is the user name that we have.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,480
Also we can list all the directories and the files that you have use and Alias.

28
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:57,350
So this so that's the list all directories that exist in C users and then the users that we're in and

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,730
we can see this is all the files that exist and directories.

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:09,710
So let's say you want to go to desktop or you can go see the desktop.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,340
Now if you do PDA and you did see the working directory you see are in desktop.

32
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,850
So we're going to do a list to see all the files that exist in desktop.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,410
And as you can see that there is nothing really except for those of gold I need now let's say this file

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,900
is important file that you want to read so you can just read it using cathe command.

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,770
Now all these commands again are aren't the help so you can just go through the help and see them and

36
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,220
now you can see what the 12. only contains.

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,150
Now let's say you want to download this file and save it to your hard drive.

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,210
You can just do download this self-taught any and it's downloaded it now for me.

39
00:02:53,210 --> 00:03:00,790
So if I go into my working into my home folder as you can see that I can see I have a file called sculped

40
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,290
ID

41
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,150
Lets say you want to upload something.

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,320
Now again I have here I have a file called said that the Axion has not it just has a I'm going to upload

43
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:21,040
the file but in practice you'd be uploading more dangerous things like viruses kill ogres reverse Yeo's

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,070
stuff like that.

45
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,170
So for now we're just going to upload something simple so we're going to do upload that do it takes

46
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,980
the and now the file is uploaded.

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,540
If we do a list we can see it right here if we do I have to make sure that it contains.

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,680
It was uploaded properly.

49
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,060
It will see that it actually contains AAA.

50
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,150
Now if this was an executable you can execute it using execute.

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,490
And then you put the file name which is the.

52
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,310
Now this will give me an error now because it's not an executable saying it's not valid Win32 application

53
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,690
but if it was executed on the target machine.

54
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,820
Now this is just like file handling.

55
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,940
Uploading doing stuff like that.

56
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,820
Let's go again on the help and see what else we can do.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,470
So again you can even get scripts and you can get plugins that you use with interpolator.

58
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,290
I'm not going to go through them in this course.

59
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,990
So let me see what else.

60
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,580
So you'll be using to use and run through on plugins or no plugins.

61
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,320
And so these were the commands that we were using the file system commands see the upload download.

62
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,920
You can make directories you can remove used in our search.

63
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,820
So basically just you just put the command name on the command that you want to run.

64
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,820
You also have your network commands right here so you can type in R.P. to get the AARP cash or display

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,770
interfaces and although we saw ifconfig how to display the interfaces these are the system command so

66
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,060
we use the execute to execute an executable.

67
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,790
You can clear events log where you can get the process number that we're working right now.

68
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,710
Now you can get the user ID.

69
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:12,910
So if you do get the it will show you the process that you're working on can do a PSA to see all the

70
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,280
processes that's running right now.

71
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:23,050
And something cool that you can do so because you're running now on this process are 3 7 8 8 and you

72
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,880
can see that it is a suspicious thing.

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,550
So it's called partial.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,590
What you can do is you can do emigrate migrate so you can migrate to a different process that is less

75
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,340
suspicious than the process that you're using right now.

76
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,400
So what we can do is we can look look for Explorer dirty.

77
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:49,000
And as you can see that it is running on to nine to eight so in order to migrate to that process we're

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:02,940
going to do great 2 2 9 8 and this will basically move our show from powerslide into ex-parte RTX.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,760
So let's get the idea.

80
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,330
And as you can see that we're actually running now through explorer.

81
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,400
If someone looks at the processes we're going to show up as if we're running from the Explorer or not

82
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:25,230
from the partial We saw the system info and still talking is an attempt to steal the token can use shell

83
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,520
which will give you a command show I'll show that to you later.

84
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,990
It'll basically just give you a Windows Comanche and you can run Windows command through it can kill

85
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,820
processes you can do reboot.

86
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,790
You can modify registry so you can just keep playing around with it and see what you can do.

87
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,520
So let's have a look on this option so this will basically allow you to insert the key logger which

88
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,370
will record any keystroke typed on the keyboard.

89
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,360
So in order to do this it's really simple it's just keys can start and that will start recording any

90
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,780
keystroke I put on my target computer.

91
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,990
So I'm going to go on say for example Google dot com.

92
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:17,010
Actually let's go to G-mail and start to sign in now.

93
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,260
It doesn't matter if it's using CTP as or if it's used in the latest security

94
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,740
because it's going to record our physical keyboard strikes so it doesn't matter if it's used the CPS

95
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,010
or not it's actually not sniffing anything.

96
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,020
So let's put the password as one two three four five six seven eight.

97
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,740
And when I come back here and do a quick scan

98
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,200
we can see that we went on Google.

99
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,560
We typed in return.

100
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,970
We went to G-mail we typed in return it went down down down down down up return because I actually didn't

101
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,100
type in say that as a security at all.

102
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,770
I just selected it from there.

103
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,060
But we recorded.

104
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,640
The password was 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8.

105
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,670
And then we had to return and not stop this we can just do Keef's can stop that and stop it.

106
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,970
So we can you can experiment with this.

107
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,540
There's a lot of other plug ins that you can do you can actually inject or upload interpretor sessions

108
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,810
that work as services that will start every time the computer starts.

109
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,080
So you can upload one like this and have it running in the background every time your target computer

110
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,050
starts so you will have access to it anytime you want.

111
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,590
You can play with this you can do a lot of things that are really cool and powerful attacks using it.

112
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,790
But I'm not going to talk about all of them again because as I said you'll need a full course for this

113
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,140
and this course is basically just talking about penetration testing use in Android.

114
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,040
One more feature I want to show you is if you just go on show it will go into Windows.

115
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,280
Also this is a normal Windows Shell as you can see see windows so you can run Windows commands so you

116
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:11,210
can do dare to list stuff you can do cd to see the so see the door does you go back see you go again

117
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,550
then you can go see the users and do any Windows commands that you want to do.
