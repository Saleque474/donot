WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:02.140
OK.

00:02.150 --> 00:07.900
So now that we are the man in the middle and all the packets are flowing through this device we're going

00:07.900 --> 00:15.000
to see how we can save all the data that gets sent into our file and we'll see how we can open the file

00:15.000 --> 00:22.050
or read it and read passwords usernames or you or else whatever that's been sent by the target person.

00:22.070 --> 00:29.120
So what we're going to do we're going to use a tool called shark shark will basically just save all

00:29.120 --> 00:36.000
this data in a file and then will read the data used in a tool called Wireshark.

00:36.470 --> 00:46.220
So first things first will start capturing detailed data using the shark so the shark.

00:46.520 --> 00:52.970
And after I usually put the wires in the device that you want to capture capture data from and in our

00:52.970 --> 01:02.520
device or NDIS zero and then put the file name that you want to store the data in and I'm going to call

01:02.520 --> 01:14.530
it capture one.

01:14.600 --> 01:20.180
And as you can see it's in it's capturing data on our NDIS zero so that's perfect.

01:20.180 --> 01:29.990
Now I'm going to go to my browser on Chrome and I'm going to maybe just go to some Web sites maybe just

01:30.080 --> 01:41.350
run a search for anything for cars.

01:41.400 --> 01:49.440
I'm going to search for a Web site called pretty site mob generate term I'm going to click on the Web

01:49.440 --> 01:57.290
site and I'm going to log in now I want to show you or I want you to note that this Web site doesn't

01:57.290 --> 01:58.750
use TTP.

01:58.970 --> 02:05.590
So it only uses CTP as you can see there is no lock icon here so it only uses HTP.

02:05.660 --> 02:09.270
So this username and password will be sent through TTP.

02:09.380 --> 02:13.490
Therefore we will be able to capture them without seeing any warnings.

02:13.490 --> 02:16.040
So the target person as you can see this is here.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.160
The target person will not see any error messages when they log in.

02:20.180 --> 02:28.250
Now the target website uses Hastey tips as such as the big Web sites such as Yahoo Hotmail Facebook

02:28.280 --> 02:29.420
Google all of them.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.160
They use Hastey CPS.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.510
Therefore if I try to navigate them their Web sites now I'll actually see a warning.

02:36.590 --> 02:41.600
And even if I don't see a warning I will not be able to read the username and password because they

02:41.600 --> 02:48.440
will be encrypted so what I'm going to do now here I'm just going to log in on and his Web site and

02:48.560 --> 02:52.530
in the future I'll show you how we can bypass Hastey CPS.

02:52.550 --> 02:57.700
So for now we're just going to log in we're going to say maybe the user name is zayd.

02:57.740 --> 03:02.630
It's who that has come I'm just going to use fake username and password.

03:02.630 --> 03:06.550
I'm going to put the password one two three four five six.

03:06.820 --> 03:15.490
Enter now I didn't log in but this this data has been sent and it should have been captured by our sniffer

03:15.490 --> 03:17.830
here so I'm going to do.

03:17.830 --> 03:27.480
I'm just going to start capturing to do a Control-C using the Android or using the terminal on Android.

03:27.510 --> 03:31.650
You need to hold the volume down button and press.

03:32.070 --> 03:38.730
So as you can see that simulator control see and that terminates any running program.

03:38.760 --> 03:46.220
So if I do ls to list the current files us should see a file called Capture.

03:46.250 --> 03:52.370
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to send that file into my laptop now so we can analyze it.

03:52.370 --> 03:58.160
Now there are you can just open it using apps on Android but it's really hard to see through the packets

03:58.640 --> 04:00.190
through the packages.

04:00.260 --> 04:05.570
And the reason you'd be using your Android anyway is just as a stealth method to steal usernames and

04:05.570 --> 04:06.890
passwords.

04:06.890 --> 04:12.800
So you'd want to be able to plug it in somewhere get it to capture data and then when you go home open

04:12.800 --> 04:14.820
the file and read what's in there.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.150
So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

04:16.150 --> 04:21.620
I'm actually going to send this file to my laptop and read it from the laptop and analyze it.

04:22.130 --> 04:28.350
So I'll just show you the file that we just captured our working directory was as D-CT files.

04:28.370 --> 04:35.930
So I'm in SD card here and I'm going to go to files and we should see a file called Capture as you can

04:35.930 --> 04:37.860
see this is it captured on.

04:38.450 --> 04:45.850
So I'm just going to send this file to my laptop and we'll see how we can analyze it using Wireshark.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.710
Right so I'm going to open Wireshark

04:51.330 --> 04:57.400
and wireshark is available on Windows and Linux and can be used to do sniffing and it can be used to

04:57.400 --> 04:58.850
just analyze packets.

04:58.900 --> 05:04.450
We will be using it in multiple classes and you will get used to how to use it and how to deal with

05:04.450 --> 05:05.160
it.

05:05.170 --> 05:10.210
So I only want to open the file that we captured using our Android device.

05:10.210 --> 05:17.200
So I'm going to go on file and open and here I am in the downloads because I just downloaded the file

05:17.590 --> 05:19.900
and it's called Capture One Cup.

05:19.900 --> 05:20.950
As you can see.

05:21.140 --> 05:30.840
I'm going to open it and here are all the packets that were sent and received by our targets computer.

05:31.190 --> 05:34.100
So let's just have a look on these packets now.

05:35.320 --> 05:39.520
The main important part of what a shark is the source destination.

05:39.670 --> 05:46.300
So the source is where the packet is going from and destination is the IP where it's going to protocol

05:46.300 --> 05:54.090
is the protocol length is the size and the info is just other info about the packet.

05:54.100 --> 05:59.920
So as you can see here for example we can see that the person was trying to access WWE.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.420
When you go being dot.com

06:04.560 --> 06:10.240
here you can see that there were requests made to send dot com.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.890
You can use this part to filter the packets.

06:12.890 --> 06:18.700
So right now I'm actually looking for the username and password so I'm only going to look for it if

06:18.800 --> 06:25.010
packets and I'm just going to type unhedged TTP and enter and that will filter and it'll only show me

06:25.160 --> 06:27.040
Hashd TTP packets.

06:27.090 --> 06:34.930
Another thing you can do is just click on the info and it will organize packets for you by their info

06:34.940 --> 06:39.830
so I'm actually looking for posts because usually when you put a username and password they're actually

06:39.830 --> 06:41.350
sent to use in post.

06:41.390 --> 06:48.120
So I'm just going to scroll down until I find a post request sent

06:52.290 --> 06:55.300
and we can see that we have all the post requests here.

06:55.530 --> 06:59.460
And this one is interesting because it says User Control Panel.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.750
So I'm going to click that one and I'm going to come here.

07:03.960 --> 07:10.260
I'm going to go on the line bays and as you can see that we can we have here is the use the action was

07:10.260 --> 07:13.970
a log in the e-mail is Zayd at yahoo dot com.

07:14.130 --> 07:17.070
And the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.
