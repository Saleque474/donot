1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:08,690
So far we've seen how we can read data and read sensitive data like usernames passwords you or else

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,920
all that kind of stuff when we are the man in the middle.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,870
Now I spoke about modifying the packets.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:25,370
So what we're going to see today is something called DNS spoofing DNS spoofing will allow us to redirect

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,600
any requests to to our domain to another domain.

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,160
For example if someone requests Facebook dot com we carried direct them to Google we carried them to

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,980
Yahoo.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,420
We carried them to our fake Facebook page.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,270
We carried them to our Facebook page that contains a Trojan and their entire computer.

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,480
We can redirect them to our own server.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:54,860
We can redirect them to any place that we want the attack is very simple and it works just because we

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,820
are the man in the middle.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:03,050
So once we run a program called DNS spoof we will configure it in a way that once it sees a certain

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,870
domain it will redirect or it will send a different response to the target person.

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,850
So I'll run the attack and you'll actually it will become clearer how it works.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,230
When I run the attack.

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,840
So first of all we're going to create a configuration file.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,870
So I've already made one here by the way.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm using a free file manager called as file manager.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,610
It's really handy as you can see it here can download it from the App Store or from the Play Store and

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,740
what I have here I have my DNS spoof configuration file.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,170
So I just have it's called DNS spoof right here.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,450
So I'm going to open it as text using the text editor.

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,380
And as you can see it's very simple.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,830
The first part of the file as you can see here I specify the IP address that I want to redirect to.

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,150
And the second part.

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,340
We put the domain that we want to hijack or that we want to spoof.

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,050
So any time a person or the target person tries to access Facebook dot com they will be redirected to

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,440
this you are out or to this IP address.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,050
Now how this works I'm going to run a program called DNS spoof and I'm going to tell the program to

31
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,630
work according to this configuration.

32
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,790
So the program whenever it sees that there is a pocket lock in for Facebook the come.

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,850
It's going to go to this IP address get the Web site that is running on this IP address and send it

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,210
instead of sending Facebook to come.

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:49,540
Simple as that if your eyes are the 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 0 you can change that to any IP you want.

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,040
This is the Web site where Facebook is going to be spoofed.

37
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,240
Now we have this particular address because I have a web server running here so I wanted to do this

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,370
using my own web server to show you that you can actually put anything there.

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,310
That web server.

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,730
And we will be doing stuff like that in the future.

41
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,860
We will be using fake Web sites or fake pages so you can actually just put a fake page on this web server.

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,790
And then they're going to see it instead of seeing the actual page.

43
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,880
For now I just have a basic just a hasty M-L page for a demonstration in this class.

44
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,920
But in the future as I said we will be doing more advanced of.

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,680
So the web server is running here on another virtual machine this virtual machine as I call it in this

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,010
machine.

47
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,650
Again you don't have to do this you can redirect to anywhere you want.

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,430
I'm just doing it here to show you.

49
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,290
So this is actually al-Khalil the next machine.

50
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:51,700
So Candy we're using our version of card on our Android device but there's also a Kalli distribution

51
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,130
that you can install as a virtual machine or as a main machine and it has all the tools that you need

52
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,980
for penetration testing.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,080
So I'll just show you here what I have or what's going to redirect to.

54
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,790
So bar W.W. that's where the server is.

55
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:15,440
And I basically just have an index attached Well just a normal Hastey page that just says yolo.

56
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,980
Now you can change this to anything you want.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,010
As I said we're just doing a demonstration here so you should actually start the server.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,350
The web server on your machine.

59
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,380
Again you don't have to do this if you're using another IP address and I'll show you that this is the

60
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,810
machine that we're going to redirect to.

61
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,270
So as you can see this is the IP of the machine and that's what we are redirecting to here.

62
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,570
And our Android device.

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,590
So the configuration is done as you can see.

64
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,560
Now all we have to do and we are already in the middle because we're using about us we attack.

65
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,680
So all I'm going to do is just go back to my terminal and I'm going to run DNS spoof.

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,070
So DNS

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,610
you put the interface.

68
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:14,880
So our interface is or and is zero and you put the configuration file that we just created.

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
The file is stored and as the card

70
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,800
files

71
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,920
DNS

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,740
now DNS spoof is running.

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,380
Let's go try to access Facebook and see what happens.

74
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,670
And as you can see I got redirected to a page just saying yolo.

75
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,920
As I said you can change this to whatever you want.

76
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:06,170
And you can see here that this doesn't change so it's still saying it's going to Devante them to the

77
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,550
windows.

78
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,990
Facebook does come but we are not in Facebook we went somewhere else.

79
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,140
So this can be used to serve a fake Facebook page and wife has haziest.

80
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,840
Yes.

81
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,190
So if the target person was using hate Yes you can just create yourself a fake Facebook page and get

82
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:32,050
him to log in to that from here and this way you'll be able you want to decrypt and haters to hate.

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,830
Yes but you'll be able to redirect him to a fake page and gain access to their username and password.

84
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,660
You can also get them to download something and that will be a backdoor you can do a lot of things with

85
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,570
DNS spoofing.

86
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,680
And we will see how useful it is and how we can use it in different attacks.
