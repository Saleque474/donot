00:01.440 --> 00:08.430
So far we've seen how we can capture usernames and passwords using our Android device only by connecting

00:08.430 --> 00:10.200
it to the target computer.

00:10.200 --> 00:16.620
Now the only problem is that if the person tries to logon to a Web site or uses his shitty POS such

00:16.650 --> 00:23.590
as Yahoo or Hotmail to bypass that we're going to use a tool called SSL Strip.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.370
Now as a sales rep is not going to decrypt SSL or do anything like that.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.730
Oh it's going to do is downgrade and he hates it if he has connection to hasty t.p.

00:33.870 --> 00:40.440
So when you pose for example log in Dot yahoo dot com you automatically go to the hashtag CPS version

00:40.440 --> 00:41.430
of that Web site.

00:41.430 --> 00:46.910
What SSL strip is going to do is going to detect that and it's going to redirect you to the Haitian

00:47.220 --> 00:48.920
version.

00:49.090 --> 00:55.390
The target person will not see any warnings and you will be able to capture the username and password

00:55.390 --> 00:59.900
the same way we did before because essentially the connection is not shitty anymore.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.840
It's just TTP.

01:02.380 --> 01:05.530
So in order to do this we're actually going to need to run two commands.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.790
The first command is just an IP tables command.

01:08.800 --> 01:15.940
As I said IP tables is just a firewall and Linux firewall and this command is going to redirect any

01:15.940 --> 01:20.370
packet on port 80 is going to redirect it to port 10000.

01:22.310 --> 01:26.450
We do this because SSL strip runs by default on port 10000.

01:26.720 --> 01:32.390
So you can change the port that Sellstrom runs on and all they have to do is just change this command

01:32.450 --> 01:35.970
and get it to redirect to strip port.

01:36.050 --> 01:39.020
Once you run this command you are going to run SSL strip.

01:39.110 --> 01:46.330
Basically SSL so then it's going to listen whenever he's actually CBS is going to downgrade it to TTP.

01:46.370 --> 01:47.900
So let's see how we do this.

01:47.900 --> 01:56.620
So we have our Android device here again and I'm going to start sniffing just like I did last time and

01:56.650 --> 01:58.850
I'm going to call the file capture to this time

02:07.200 --> 02:07.850
OK.

02:08.020 --> 02:16.250
Enter.

02:16.430 --> 02:18.670
And here we go we're capturing packets now.

02:19.040 --> 02:24.110
So the next thing we're going to do is run the two commands that I just showed you to run as a small

02:24.110 --> 02:24.840
strobe.

02:24.980 --> 02:28.520
So I'm just going to go and open up a new terminal window

02:37.900 --> 02:46.350
so it's window to right here and we're going to run our IP tables come on so IP tables

02:53.600 --> 02:57.640
and I have the command here just written in the file so I'm just going to copy and paste it

03:14.010 --> 03:19.760
in and turn on because there is no errors that means the command has worked successfully and the next

03:19.760 --> 03:21.530
thing we're just going to run SSL strobe

03:25.090 --> 03:31.110
and wind speed to tell it to only log on you work on the post requests.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.980
They're usually the post requests of the ones that are used to log in.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.480
So where are you going to.

03:37.490 --> 03:42.730
Or are you trying to get usernames and passwords so we only wanted to work on post requests.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.710
So everything is working now everything's perfect.

03:44.710 --> 03:50.770
I'm going to go on my target which is this device and we're going to try to go to mail at yahoo dot

03:50.770 --> 04:03.190
com and try to logon.

04:03.220 --> 04:08.610
Now I'd like you to note that this Web site is not actually CPS it's normal hey CTP as you can see here.

04:08.660 --> 04:09.980
There's nice utopias.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.990
So that means SSL Strip has worked successfully.

04:13.210 --> 04:18.450
Now if you look at my android window you actually see some warnings here but that's OK.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.890
You get these anyway but it's working.

04:21.100 --> 04:27.040
So I'm going to log in to my username I'm just going to say again Zayd let's say something else or to

04:27.040 --> 04:35.590
say to you who is Garmin going to put a password this time I'm going to put nine eight seven six five

04:35.590 --> 04:37.680
four I'm going to enter that.

04:37.690 --> 04:45.110
Again these are wrong usernames and passwords I'm just using them to demonstrate the attack.

04:45.130 --> 04:51.550
I'm also going to go to Mount.

04:51.630 --> 05:07.390
I'm going to log in I'm going to call it a hotmail took out come and say the password is Hotmail pass.

05:07.430 --> 05:11.220
Again wrong usernames and passwords just for demonstration.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.490
So now we logged in.

05:13.550 --> 05:15.880
I'm going to do the same as what we did before.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.960
So I will stop capturing here.

05:17.960 --> 05:23.510
I'm actually going to stop as the cell strip controls the volume down and see and then I'm going to

05:23.520 --> 05:24.830
start capturing here.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.330
And I'm going to go to my file manager right here.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.270
And we should see a file called Capture to here.

05:35.340 --> 05:37.120
And as you can see it right there.

05:37.350 --> 05:39.980
So I'm going to send this file to my laptop.

05:39.990 --> 05:45.190
I'm going to open it and Wireshark and we'll try to analyze it and see our usernames and passwords.

05:46.550 --> 05:50.360
OK I downloaded the file now and I'm going to run Wireshark.

05:50.960 --> 05:58.670
And just like before I'm going to go file open and we have our captures to here I'm going to open it.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.730
And again just like before.

06:00.740 --> 06:08.180
I'm going to firster by his TTP and it's already organized in them by the info so I'm just going to

06:08.180 --> 06:13.090
scroll down to post.

06:13.100 --> 06:13.850
Actually it's not.

06:13.850 --> 06:17.060
So I'm going to click on info.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.360
I'm gonna scroll to posts.

06:22.340 --> 06:28.100
And we have three four post requests that have been sent by our target.

06:28.340 --> 06:30.090
So let's look at the first one.

06:30.560 --> 06:36.800
And we're going to look at the line based on as you can see I was trying to log in with a user name

06:36.800 --> 06:43.050
called they too and the password nine eight seven six five four.

06:43.140 --> 06:46.370
Let's look at the other one and the other one.

06:46.370 --> 06:48.400
As you can see here this is the ultimate one.

06:48.420 --> 06:56.500
So it was a hot melt at hotmail dot com and the password was Hotmail POS.

06:56.540 --> 07:01.080
Now I said so strip works to bypass safety CPS.

07:01.160 --> 07:07.130
The only problem with it these days is that it does some Web sites like Google and Facebook are using

07:07.180 --> 07:11.520
a new technology called hater's ts.

07:11.580 --> 07:17.650
Basically what that does is it will not serve you the web site unless it is a hasty tibias Web site.

07:17.670 --> 07:22.480
So it wants to review a DTP Web site or DTP version of that Web site.

07:22.740 --> 07:29.100
Therefore SSL strip does not work against these against Gmail and Facebook right now if you're using

07:29.100 --> 07:35.070
Chrome browser songy Chrome browser supports it and only Facebook and Google are using it at the moment.
