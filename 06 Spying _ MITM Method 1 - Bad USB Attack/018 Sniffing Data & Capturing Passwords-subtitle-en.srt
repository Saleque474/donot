1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,140
OK.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,900
So now that we are the man in the middle and all the packets are flowing through this device we're going

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:15,000
to see how we can save all the data that gets sent into our file and we'll see how we can open the file

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,050
or read it and read passwords usernames or you or else whatever that's been sent by the target person.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:29,120
So what we're going to do we're going to use a tool called shark shark will basically just save all

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,000
this data in a file and then will read the data used in a tool called Wireshark.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:46,220
So first things first will start capturing detailed data using the shark so the shark.

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,970
And after I usually put the wires in the device that you want to capture capture data from and in our

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:02,520
device or NDIS zero and then put the file name that you want to store the data in and I'm going to call

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:14,530
it capture one.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,180
And as you can see it's in it's capturing data on our NDIS zero so that's perfect.

12
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:29,990
Now I'm going to go to my browser on Chrome and I'm going to maybe just go to some Web sites maybe just

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:41,350
run a search for anything for cars.

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm going to search for a Web site called pretty site mob generate term I'm going to click on the Web

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:57,290
site and I'm going to log in now I want to show you or I want you to note that this Web site doesn't

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,750
use TTP.

17
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:05,590
So it only uses CTP as you can see there is no lock icon here so it only uses HTP.

18
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,270
So this username and password will be sent through TTP.

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,490
Therefore we will be able to capture them without seeing any warnings.

20
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,040
So the target person as you can see this is here.

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,160
The target person will not see any error messages when they log in.

22
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,250
Now the target website uses Hastey tips as such as the big Web sites such as Yahoo Hotmail Facebook

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,420
Google all of them.

24
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,160
They use Hastey CPS.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,510
Therefore if I try to navigate them their Web sites now I'll actually see a warning.

26
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,600
And even if I don't see a warning I will not be able to read the username and password because they

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,440
will be encrypted so what I'm going to do now here I'm just going to log in on and his Web site and

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,530
in the future I'll show you how we can bypass Hastey CPS.

29
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,700
So for now we're just going to log in we're going to say maybe the user name is zayd.

30
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,630
It's who that has come I'm just going to use fake username and password.

31
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,550
I'm going to put the password one two three four five six.

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,490
Enter now I didn't log in but this this data has been sent and it should have been captured by our sniffer

33
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,830
here so I'm going to do.

34
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm just going to start capturing to do a Control-C using the Android or using the terminal on Android.

35
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,650
You need to hold the volume down button and press.

36
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,730
So as you can see that simulator control see and that terminates any running program.

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,220
So if I do ls to list the current files us should see a file called Capture.

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,370
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to send that file into my laptop now so we can analyze it.

39
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,160
Now there are you can just open it using apps on Android but it's really hard to see through the packets

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,190
through the packages.

41
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,570
And the reason you'd be using your Android anyway is just as a stealth method to steal usernames and

42
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,890
passwords.

43
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,800
So you'd want to be able to plug it in somewhere get it to capture data and then when you go home open

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,820
the file and read what's in there.

45
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,150
So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

46
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,620
I'm actually going to send this file to my laptop and read it from the laptop and analyze it.

47
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,350
So I'll just show you the file that we just captured our working directory was as D-CT files.

48
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:35,930
So I'm in SD card here and I'm going to go to files and we should see a file called Capture as you can

49
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,860
see this is it captured on.

50
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:45,850
So I'm just going to send this file to my laptop and we'll see how we can analyze it using Wireshark.

51
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,710
Right so I'm going to open Wireshark

52
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,400
and wireshark is available on Windows and Linux and can be used to do sniffing and it can be used to

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,850
just analyze packets.

54
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,450
We will be using it in multiple classes and you will get used to how to use it and how to deal with

55
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,160
it.

56
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,210
So I only want to open the file that we captured using our Android device.

57
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:17,200
So I'm going to go on file and open and here I am in the downloads because I just downloaded the file

58
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,900
and it's called Capture One Cup.

59
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,950
As you can see.

60
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm going to open it and here are all the packets that were sent and received by our targets computer.

61
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,100
So let's just have a look on these packets now.

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,520
The main important part of what a shark is the source destination.

63
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:46,300
So the source is where the packet is going from and destination is the IP where it's going to protocol

64
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:54,090
is the protocol length is the size and the info is just other info about the packet.

65
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,920
So as you can see here for example we can see that the person was trying to access WWE.

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,420
When you go being dot.com

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,240
here you can see that there were requests made to send dot com.

68
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,890
You can use this part to filter the packets.

69
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,700
So right now I'm actually looking for the username and password so I'm only going to look for it if

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,010
packets and I'm just going to type unhedged TTP and enter and that will filter and it'll only show me

71
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Hashd TTP packets.

72
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:34,930
Another thing you can do is just click on the info and it will organize packets for you by their info

73
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,830
so I'm actually looking for posts because usually when you put a username and password they're actually

74
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,350
sent to use in post.

75
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:48,120
So I'm just going to scroll down until I find a post request sent

76
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,300
and we can see that we have all the post requests here.

77
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,460
And this one is interesting because it says User Control Panel.

78
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,750
So I'm going to click that one and I'm going to come here.

79
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,260
I'm going to go on the line bays and as you can see that we can we have here is the use the action was

80
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,970
a log in the e-mail is Zayd at yahoo dot com.

81
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,070
And the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.
