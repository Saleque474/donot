WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:08.690
So far we've seen how we can read data and read sensitive data like usernames passwords you or else

00:08.720 --> 00:13.920
all that kind of stuff when we are the man in the middle.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.870
Now I spoke about modifying the packets.

00:17.020 --> 00:25.370
So what we're going to see today is something called DNS spoofing DNS spoofing will allow us to redirect

00:25.450 --> 00:28.600
any requests to to our domain to another domain.

00:28.610 --> 00:34.160
For example if someone requests Facebook dot com we carried direct them to Google we carried them to

00:34.160 --> 00:34.980
Yahoo.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.420
We carried them to our fake Facebook page.

00:37.580 --> 00:43.270
We carried them to our Facebook page that contains a Trojan and their entire computer.

00:43.370 --> 00:46.480
We can redirect them to our own server.

00:46.580 --> 00:54.860
We can redirect them to any place that we want the attack is very simple and it works just because we

00:54.860 --> 00:55.820
are the man in the middle.

00:55.820 --> 01:03.050
So once we run a program called DNS spoof we will configure it in a way that once it sees a certain

01:03.050 --> 01:08.870
domain it will redirect or it will send a different response to the target person.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.850
So I'll run the attack and you'll actually it will become clearer how it works.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.230
When I run the attack.

01:16.430 --> 01:20.840
So first of all we're going to create a configuration file.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.870
So I've already made one here by the way.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.800
I'm using a free file manager called as file manager.

01:27.800 --> 01:34.610
It's really handy as you can see it here can download it from the App Store or from the Play Store and

01:35.920 --> 01:39.740
what I have here I have my DNS spoof configuration file.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.170
So I just have it's called DNS spoof right here.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.450
So I'm going to open it as text using the text editor.

01:48.970 --> 01:52.380
And as you can see it's very simple.

01:52.480 --> 01:59.830
The first part of the file as you can see here I specify the IP address that I want to redirect to.

02:00.070 --> 02:01.150
And the second part.

02:01.150 --> 02:06.340
We put the domain that we want to hijack or that we want to spoof.

02:06.340 --> 02:14.050
So any time a person or the target person tries to access Facebook dot com they will be redirected to

02:14.290 --> 02:17.440
this you are out or to this IP address.

02:17.440 --> 02:23.050
Now how this works I'm going to run a program called DNS spoof and I'm going to tell the program to

02:23.050 --> 02:25.630
work according to this configuration.

02:25.690 --> 02:30.790
So the program whenever it sees that there is a pocket lock in for Facebook the come.

02:30.910 --> 02:36.850
It's going to go to this IP address get the Web site that is running on this IP address and send it

02:36.880 --> 02:39.210
instead of sending Facebook to come.

02:39.340 --> 02:49.540
Simple as that if your eyes are the 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 0 you can change that to any IP you want.

02:49.540 --> 02:55.040
This is the Web site where Facebook is going to be spoofed.

02:55.100 --> 03:02.240
Now we have this particular address because I have a web server running here so I wanted to do this

03:02.240 --> 03:06.370
using my own web server to show you that you can actually put anything there.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.310
That web server.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.730
And we will be doing stuff like that in the future.

03:09.740 --> 03:15.860
We will be using fake Web sites or fake pages so you can actually just put a fake page on this web server.

03:16.010 --> 03:19.790
And then they're going to see it instead of seeing the actual page.

03:19.790 --> 03:24.880
For now I just have a basic just a hasty M-L page for a demonstration in this class.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.920
But in the future as I said we will be doing more advanced of.

03:28.080 --> 03:35.680
So the web server is running here on another virtual machine this virtual machine as I call it in this

03:35.680 --> 03:36.010
machine.

03:36.010 --> 03:39.650
Again you don't have to do this you can redirect to anywhere you want.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.430
I'm just doing it here to show you.

03:41.650 --> 03:44.290
So this is actually al-Khalil the next machine.

03:44.290 --> 03:51.700
So Candy we're using our version of card on our Android device but there's also a Kalli distribution

03:51.730 --> 03:57.130
that you can install as a virtual machine or as a main machine and it has all the tools that you need

03:57.130 --> 03:59.980
for penetration testing.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.080
So I'll just show you here what I have or what's going to redirect to.

04:04.090 --> 04:08.790
So bar W.W. that's where the server is.

04:08.910 --> 04:15.440
And I basically just have an index attached Well just a normal Hastey page that just says yolo.

04:15.450 --> 04:16.980
Now you can change this to anything you want.

04:16.980 --> 04:23.010
As I said we're just doing a demonstration here so you should actually start the server.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.350
The web server on your machine.

04:25.350 --> 04:32.380
Again you don't have to do this if you're using another IP address and I'll show you that this is the

04:32.380 --> 04:36.810
machine that we're going to redirect to.

04:36.820 --> 04:42.270
So as you can see this is the IP of the machine and that's what we are redirecting to here.

04:42.310 --> 04:44.570
And our Android device.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.590
So the configuration is done as you can see.

04:48.590 --> 04:54.560
Now all we have to do and we are already in the middle because we're using about us we attack.

04:54.560 --> 04:59.680
So all I'm going to do is just go back to my terminal and I'm going to run DNS spoof.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.070
So DNS

05:03.670 --> 05:05.610
you put the interface.

05:05.710 --> 05:14.880
So our interface is or and is zero and you put the configuration file that we just created.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.280
The file is stored and as the card

05:22.170 --> 05:22.800
files

05:27.930 --> 05:28.920
DNS

05:33.920 --> 05:35.740
now DNS spoof is running.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.380
Let's go try to access Facebook and see what happens.

05:52.410 --> 05:56.670
And as you can see I got redirected to a page just saying yolo.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.920
As I said you can change this to whatever you want.

06:00.390 --> 06:06.170
And you can see here that this doesn't change so it's still saying it's going to Devante them to the

06:06.220 --> 06:06.550
windows.

06:06.550 --> 06:10.990
Facebook does come but we are not in Facebook we went somewhere else.

06:11.020 --> 06:16.140
So this can be used to serve a fake Facebook page and wife has haziest.

06:16.150 --> 06:16.840
Yes.

06:17.840 --> 06:25.190
So if the target person was using hate Yes you can just create yourself a fake Facebook page and get

06:25.190 --> 06:32.050
him to log in to that from here and this way you'll be able you want to decrypt and haters to hate.

06:32.200 --> 06:38.830
Yes but you'll be able to redirect him to a fake page and gain access to their username and password.

06:38.840 --> 06:44.660
You can also get them to download something and that will be a backdoor you can do a lot of things with

06:44.660 --> 06:45.570
DNS spoofing.

06:45.590 --> 06:50.680
And we will see how useful it is and how we can use it in different attacks.
