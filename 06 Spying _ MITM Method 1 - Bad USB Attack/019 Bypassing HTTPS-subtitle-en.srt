1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:08,430
So far we've seen how we can capture usernames and passwords using our Android device only by connecting

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,200
it to the target computer.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,620
Now the only problem is that if the person tries to logon to a Web site or uses his shitty POS such

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,590
as Yahoo or Hotmail to bypass that we're going to use a tool called SSL Strip.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,370
Now as a sales rep is not going to decrypt SSL or do anything like that.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,730
Oh it's going to do is downgrade and he hates it if he has connection to hasty t.p.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,440
So when you pose for example log in Dot yahoo dot com you automatically go to the hashtag CPS version

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,430
of that Web site.

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,910
What SSL strip is going to do is going to detect that and it's going to redirect you to the Haitian

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,920
version.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:55,390
The target person will not see any warnings and you will be able to capture the username and password

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,900
the same way we did before because essentially the connection is not shitty anymore.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,840
It's just TTP.

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,530
So in order to do this we're actually going to need to run two commands.

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,790
The first command is just an IP tables command.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,940
As I said IP tables is just a firewall and Linux firewall and this command is going to redirect any

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,370
packet on port 80 is going to redirect it to port 10000.

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,450
We do this because SSL strip runs by default on port 10000.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,390
So you can change the port that Sellstrom runs on and all they have to do is just change this command

20
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,970
and get it to redirect to strip port.

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,020
Once you run this command you are going to run SSL strip.

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:46,330
Basically SSL so then it's going to listen whenever he's actually CBS is going to downgrade it to TTP.

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,900
So let's see how we do this.

24
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:56,620
So we have our Android device here again and I'm going to start sniffing just like I did last time and

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,850
I'm going to call the file capture to this time

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,850
OK.

27
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:16,250
Enter.

28
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,670
And here we go we're capturing packets now.

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,110
So the next thing we're going to do is run the two commands that I just showed you to run as a small

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,840
strobe.

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,520
So I'm just going to go and open up a new terminal window

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:46,350
so it's window to right here and we're going to run our IP tables come on so IP tables

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,640
and I have the command here just written in the file so I'm just going to copy and paste it

34
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,760
in and turn on because there is no errors that means the command has worked successfully and the next

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,530
thing we're just going to run SSL strobe

36
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,110
and wind speed to tell it to only log on you work on the post requests.

37
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,980
They're usually the post requests of the ones that are used to log in.

38
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,480
So where are you going to.

39
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,730
Or are you trying to get usernames and passwords so we only wanted to work on post requests.

40
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,710
So everything is working now everything's perfect.

41
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:50,770
I'm going to go on my target which is this device and we're going to try to go to mail at yahoo dot

42
00:03:50,770 --> 00:04:03,190
com and try to logon.

43
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,610
Now I'd like you to note that this Web site is not actually CPS it's normal hey CTP as you can see here.

44
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,980
There's nice utopias.

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,990
So that means SSL Strip has worked successfully.

46
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,450
Now if you look at my android window you actually see some warnings here but that's OK.

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,890
You get these anyway but it's working.

48
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,040
So I'm going to log in to my username I'm just going to say again Zayd let's say something else or to

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:35,590
say to you who is Garmin going to put a password this time I'm going to put nine eight seven six five

50
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,680
four I'm going to enter that.

51
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:45,110
Again these are wrong usernames and passwords I'm just using them to demonstrate the attack.

52
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,550
I'm also going to go to Mount.

53
00:04:51,630 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm going to log in I'm going to call it a hotmail took out come and say the password is Hotmail pass.

54
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,220
Again wrong usernames and passwords just for demonstration.

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,490
So now we logged in.

56
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm going to do the same as what we did before.

57
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,960
So I will stop capturing here.

58
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,510
I'm actually going to stop as the cell strip controls the volume down and see and then I'm going to

59
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,830
start capturing here.

60
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,330
And I'm going to go to my file manager right here.

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,270
And we should see a file called Capture to here.

62
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,120
And as you can see it right there.

63
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,980
So I'm going to send this file to my laptop.

64
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,190
I'm going to open it and Wireshark and we'll try to analyze it and see our usernames and passwords.

65
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,360
OK I downloaded the file now and I'm going to run Wireshark.

66
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,670
And just like before I'm going to go file open and we have our captures to here I'm going to open it.

67
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,730
And again just like before.

68
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm going to firster by his TTP and it's already organized in them by the info so I'm just going to

69
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,090
scroll down to post.

70
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,850
Actually it's not.

71
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,060
So I'm going to click on info.

72
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm gonna scroll to posts.

73
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,100
And we have three four post requests that have been sent by our target.

74
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,090
So let's look at the first one.

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,800
And we're going to look at the line based on as you can see I was trying to log in with a user name

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,050
called they too and the password nine eight seven six five four.

77
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,370
Let's look at the other one and the other one.

78
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,400
As you can see here this is the ultimate one.

79
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:56,500
So it was a hot melt at hotmail dot com and the password was Hotmail POS.

80
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,080
Now I said so strip works to bypass safety CPS.

81
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,130
The only problem with it these days is that it does some Web sites like Google and Facebook are using

82
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,520
a new technology called hater's ts.

83
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,650
Basically what that does is it will not serve you the web site unless it is a hasty tibias Web site.

84
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,480
So it wants to review a DTP Web site or DTP version of that Web site.

85
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,100
Therefore SSL strip does not work against these against Gmail and Facebook right now if you're using

86
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,070
Chrome browser songy Chrome browser supports it and only Facebook and Google are using it at the moment.
