1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,730
It the next few classes we're going to talk about an attack called Bad USP.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,310
Man in the middle attack and this attack we're going to use our Android device and physically plug it

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,560
in into the target device used in the US pre-cable.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,200
Now you usually do that to charge the device or to transfer data between the devices.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,920
So you're going to go when you're going to plug in your Android device to the target's computer.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,510
And once you do that our Android device.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,790
And so they've stolen the computer that it is a media device or that is it is a phone it's actually

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,730
going to tell the computer that it is a network device.

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Not only that but it's also going to force all the traffic going to and from the target's computer to

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,260
go through our Android device.

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,670
This means that all user names all passwords all of you are elves or chat messages.

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,760
Everything that the target computer is going to do.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,140
And whenever it tries to access the Internet it's going to do that through our device or it's going

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,880
to it's going to use our Android device as a network card and send all the requests and responses will

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,900
be flowing through our Android device instead of making them flow through its internal Wi-Fi card or

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,750
wire card or ethernet or whatever.

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,720
So basically our Android device is going to be used as a network card and all the packets all the data

18
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,840
will be flowing through with the Android device.

19
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:41,580
Now in order to set the device in that way we have to do a few steps.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,960
So let's go to the kallah device and see how we can do this now you can actually do this using the Kalli

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,620
menu.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,520
But for some reason the menu is not working for me.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,310
That's why I'm going to be doing it from the terminal.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,150
So let's see how we can actually do it from the terminal.

25
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:08,410
So I have my Android device here and I'm going to go to the hunter home and I'm not going to go through

26
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,510
the menu so you can actually go here to the but you SBM out in the middle attack and start the attack

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,210
from here.

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,670
Well it's not working for me so that's why I'm actually just going to launch a terminal and I'm going

29
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,400
to do the attack from the terminal.

30
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,900
Now the first thing that I'm going to do is navigate to SD card

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,410
files so CD is just the command to change the working directory.

32
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,230
Now I have a file there and the resources you can download it yourself.

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,950
I call that a flush IP tables.

34
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:56,090
Basically this file contains a number of commands that will clear all the rules are there and the IP

35
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,440
tables IP tables is just a firewall that's used in Linux.

36
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,080
Now some rules might cause our device to draw packets because it'll see them as a threat.

37
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,460
So what we want we want the packets to flow through our device and we wanted to act as a network and

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,980
therefore I have a few comments in that file that will basically just delete all rules that you might

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,640
have in your IP tables.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,370
So to execute that just download the file from the resources and executed using this command Bash and

41
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,500
put the name of the file which is flush

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:40,630
IP tables that SH And because you don't see any error messages that means everything was executed successfully.

43
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,200
Now the next thing that we want to do is run WSP attack run the attacks that fuels the target computer

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,600
that this is a network card when we connect it to the target computer so well I'm going to do is brush

45
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,310
and just put the name of the file.

46
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,070
It's another.

47
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,120
Again it's another script but this script comes in with Nat hunter so you don't need to download it

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,980
just right like this.

49
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,750
So it starts but USP

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,840
kids can't do it.

51
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,560
SH No if you have Android 5 use the lollipop one since I have kids cost four point four point four.

52
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:29,140
So I'm using Kit-Kat and I'm going to hit enter and because you don't see any error messages I guess

53
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,610
that means everything was run successfully.

54
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,560
So now the attack is working on the device.

55
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,850
And once I connected the device using the U.S. cable it's going to fool the computer that it connects

56
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,510
to.

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,990
Now I forgot to mention this this attack should work on Windows and the next box and I'm going to be

58
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,810
running it on Linux now and in the future I'll be in a similar attack and I'll run that on Windows just

59
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,950
to show you that they both work on both operating systems.

60
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,650
So I'll show you here I'm actually connected to my network here to to

61
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,160
go running.

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,210
This is this is just to show you that how the IPs are going to change so you actually don't need to

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,880
do this when you're running the attack.

64
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,590
So I'm just going to run.

65
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,820
I'm sorry ifconfig.

66
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,500
And I'll show you what is.

67
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,400
So this is the IP address my current IP address and my current network.

68
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,100
And as you can see that's the one that's being used to connect to the Internet.

69
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:38,560
So I'm going to connect my Android device this device device that's been mirrored here I'm just going

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,310
to connect it physically to this computer.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,840
So it's connected now.

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,690
And as you can see I've got a message here telling me that I got connected to using a wired connection.

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,080
So this is the only way that a person can actually get suspicious as as long as soon as this message

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,440
disappears then they won't notice it.

75
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,070
Now if we actually go on a Iran if conflict again I'll show you how the IP changes now.

76
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,490
And as you can see now I have an extra card now if conflict shows you the network that you have the

77
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,110
commands that I just ran here.

78
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,670
So as you can see that I have an extra card connected and an extra network connected.

79
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,850
It has this IP address.

80
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:36,490
So basically now anything I'm going to do on this computer will be throw a flowing through this Android

81
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,980
device so any user names that I put on the internet and your passwords and your messages and your Else

82
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,340
everything is going to be flowing through this nexus device the Nexus device will execute the request

83
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,050
and send it back to our device.

84
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,800
So everything is going to be working but it's going to be flowing through this device which makes it

85
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,900
the man in the middle which means that all the packets will be flowing through this device and we can

86
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,430
read them we can modify them and we can do whatever we want with them.

87
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,990
Now let's just confirm that I actually have internet connection so I'm just going to run a browser here.

88
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:22,660
I'm gonna go to being dot come and as you can see I do have Internet connection and everything is perfect.

89
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,730
Both the packets are actually flowing through this device.

90
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,780
And the next class is now.

91
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,250
We'll see how we can actually capture these packets save them in a file read them modify them and we'll

92
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,330
see what kind of stuff we can actually do with them.
