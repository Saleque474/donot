1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,400
Now throughout the course we're going to be using a number of penetration testing tools.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,610
You can go ahead and install each of these tools manually or you can do what most protesters do including

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,510
myself and save time and effort and use an operating system designed for Hocken.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,340
We're going to be using an operating system called Kalli Linux and it's just a flavor of Linux based

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,040
on Debian and it comes in with all the programs and the applications that we need to use pre-installed

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,540
and pre-configured.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,600
This means that we can just install this operating system and then start learning our Hocking.

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,740
There are two options to install Kallie.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,590
You can install it as a virtual machine inside your current operating system or you can install it as

10
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,680
a main machine as a main operating system.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,830
Throughout the course I'm actually going to be using it as a virtual machine because using it as a virtual

12
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,890
machine works exactly the same as installing it as a mean machine because it will be completely isolated

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,370
from your computer because it's only going to run inside virtual box.

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,470
So if you break it or if you mess things up it's very very easy to fix.

15
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:15,130
It's very easy to go back to other snapshots other configurations and also you won't lose any functionality

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,490
by using it as a virtual machine.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,610
That's why I always use it as a virtual machine.

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,470
In this lecture I'm going to cover how to install it as a virtual machine inside virtual box.

19
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,500
Now I'm going to be doing the steps on the Mac OS X computer but these tapes are exactly the same regardless

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,510
of what operating system you use.

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,940
So if you're on Windows or on Linux you just have to download the Virtual Box version of your computer

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,780
and then the steps shown in this lecture are exactly the same after installing Virtual Box going include

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,740
the download link in the resources of this lecture.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,050
I have it already opened in here.

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,300
All you have to do is just scroll down.

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,090
Make sure you click on the calendar next virtual box images not on the VM where and then download the

27
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,930
version of Cali's that's compatible with your system.

28
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,480
So if you have a 64 bit computer download the 64 bits.

29
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,300
If the if you have the 32 bits download the 32 bits now one click on this will start to download for

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,070
you.

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,720
If you're using Internet Explorer or edge browser then you're going to have to right click and save

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,750
target as on Chrome and Firefox you can just click the link.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,300
Now this is downloading for me and I'm going to stop it because I've already downloaded so I already

34
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,050
have it downloaded in here.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,790
And as you can see you should get a file with a dot over the extension so you have the name followed

36
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,520
by dot or a in here.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:52,320
So to solve this in a virtual box all you have to do is literally just double click the file and as

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,450
you can see I get a window which will allow me to import this virtual machine.

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:08,160
Now I'm going to keep everything the same for now and I'm just going to click on import.

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,770
Now that said the virtual machine is ready to be used now before I started I want to show you how to

41
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,240
modify some of its settings so I'm going to click on it.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,870
Then we're going to click on the settings in here and the first thing that I'm going to do.

43
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,090
I'm going to go to System and I'm going to modify the amount of RAM it has now dependent on how much

44
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,390
total RAM you have on your computer.

45
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,980
You can leave this at 2 if you want but one gigabyte is enough for Cadie.

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,680
I usually leave it to because I have 16 gigs of RAM but if you have less 1 gigabyte is enough for it.

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,420
Also a few come here on the processors.

48
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,130
You'll see that by default I have two processors assigned to it.

49
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,420
Again I have 8 per use.

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,170
So two is not going to cause too much pressure on my computer.

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,180
If you have less.

52
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,890
Once is enough for Kalli.

53
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:11,860
Now we're going to go to the network settings and we're going to set this to use and not network.

54
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,230
Now sometimes when you set this to another network you won't see a network name in here.

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:24,170
If you don't please check out my link in the resources and it will show you how to create and not network.

56
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:30,110
For me it already has a network so I'm going to keep it on this one and what the setting basically does

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,580
is it's going to create a virtual network where my host machine which is my Mac OS X computer in here

58
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,940
is going to be the router for this network and then all the virtual machines are going to be clients

59
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,110
connected to this network.

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,370
So they're going to get Internet connection from my host machine and at the same time all of my virtual

61
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,310
machines will be connected to a virtual network.

62
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,220
This is very handy because my virtual machines will be able to communicate with each other.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,660
We can use one of them to hack into the other.

64
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,500
We can use it to test networks attacks and much more so it'll first allow my virtual machines to have

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,670
Internet connection.

66
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,730
It also allow them to communicate with each other and it'll do all of this through a virtual network.

67
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,240
It will not use any of your wireless adapters or any of your wireless cards.

68
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,830
It will create a virtual Internet network.

69
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,650
So as far as the virtual machine is concerned they're going to think that they're connected to a network

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,400
through a wire so that's it I'm done with my settings right now and I'm going to click on OK.

71
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,890
And we can start our virtual machine now to start it.

72
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,300
All we have to do is just click on the start button in here.

73
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,840
Now I'm going to click inside the virtual machine and hit enter.

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,160
And we are inside the virtual machine.

75
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,260
Now it's asking us for the username and the default user name is root.

76
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:10,660
So our O.T. and then asking us for the password and the default password is the reverse of that which

77
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,040
is t o r

78
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,870
and that's it.

79
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,150
Now I'm inside my virtual machine now since we installed this using the ready image.

80
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:30,810
We can just click on this on the green button here or we can go to View full screen and we'll be able

81
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,210
to go in full screen and the screen will resize automatically to the size of our screen.

82
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:45,180
Now note in here you should actually see a network icon because we set this machine to use that network.

83
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,470
Since we don't have a network icon This means that this machine didn't get connected to the Nat network.

84
00:06:51,470 --> 00:07:00,480
So if I open my browser in here you'll see that it's not connected to the Internet to fix this issue.

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,320
We're just going to go all the way to the top.

86
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,390
This is going to display our menus.

87
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:13,950
We're going to go to devices network and we're going to click on Connect network adapter.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,180
You only have to do this once and then the virtual machine will automatically connect to the network.

89
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,740
Now once you do this if you give it a few seconds you'll see that I have a network icon appearing in

90
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,570
here.

91
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,530
And if I click it you'll see it looks like I'm connected to a wired network.

92
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,160
As you can see in here it says wired connected.

93
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,790
So Cali thinks it's connected to a wired network.

94
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,760
Now if I just click try again in my browser you'll see that I have internet access so that's it.

95
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,090
That shows how to install Callanan acts as a virtual machine.

96
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,740
Don't be intimidated by this new operating system.

97
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,790
We're going to go through the basics and we're going to use it a lot and it's actually going to become

98
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,020
very easy for you to use.

99
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,610
Also like I said you won't lose any functionality when you install Linux as a virtual machine.

100
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,070
It's actually better to install it as a virtual machine because it's completely isolated from your computer

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,350
and it'll be very easy to fix if things go wrong.

102
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,520
Keep in mind installing this on different hardware and different computers might show you some errors

103
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,360
on some issues.

104
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,260
So please if you have any errors just add them in the discussions and I'll help you resolve them.
