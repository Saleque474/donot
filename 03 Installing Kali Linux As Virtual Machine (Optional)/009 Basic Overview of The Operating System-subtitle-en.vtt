WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:08.960
Right now that we have Kalli Linux installed let me just show you an overview of the system what Linux

00:08.970 --> 00:09.500
is.

00:09.550 --> 00:16.240
What's the structure of the file systems are and some of the basic apps that we're going to use.

00:16.390 --> 00:21.070
Now bear with me I know the quality of the color here.

00:21.070 --> 00:25.210
Right now I'm using it in a stretched mode so it's not proper full screen.

00:25.240 --> 00:29.590
I'm doing that because there is certain programs that we need to install first.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.890
To make it support the full resolution of the screen or off the monitor and go talk about that in the

00:35.890 --> 00:40.380
next lecture because it is it's not as vast as just you need to know some commands.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.070
And I'll walk you through them.

00:42.070 --> 00:46.590
But for now I'd just like to give you an overview of the system.

00:46.600 --> 00:53.790
So as you can see here we just have a status bar very simple the Applications menu can be accessed from

00:53.790 --> 00:54.180
here.

00:54.300 --> 01:00.560
So if you click on applications you'll be able to access all the applications that come in preinstalled

01:00.570 --> 01:01.690
with clinics.

01:01.710 --> 01:07.930
And as you can see they are divided into categories in terms of the type of the attack that they get.

01:07.940 --> 01:09.350
They allow you to do so.

01:09.420 --> 01:16.410
We have information gathering vulnerability analysis web applications and databases exploitation reverse

01:16.410 --> 01:24.840
engineering all types of applications that can be used for penetration testing in the places here that

01:24.840 --> 01:28.990
allows you to access your file systems the files that you'll be using.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.740
It's something similar to my documents in Windows machines.

01:32.970 --> 01:38.690
So as you can see here if we click on computers you'll be able to access all the files and the devices

01:38.760 --> 01:45.720
you rarely go here this and usually access stuff through the home right here or through the roads through

01:45.720 --> 01:48.140
the route because we're the route users.

01:48.270 --> 01:54.900
So it's the same thing if I go to places and then go to home right here and from here you can see that

01:54.900 --> 01:58.690
you can access your desktop your documents download music whatever.

01:58.710 --> 02:08.100
Same way that you have it for Windows or for Mac OS X and you have your trashier where your trash goes.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.580
This is just a basic file manager bike for word.

02:11.670 --> 02:16.370
And then you can double click a file to run it or double click a directory to open it.

02:20.630 --> 02:26.440
Here we have again as I said the status bar here you can see the number of desktops or workspaces.

02:26.660 --> 02:33.950
Now Linux usually supports workspaces so you can have different Windows running on different workspaces.

02:33.950 --> 02:39.080
Now at the moment I have no windows running so there's I can't really go to the second word a second

02:39.470 --> 02:40.190
workplace.

02:40.340 --> 02:46.340
Well for example if I had my file manager open here I can go to our next workspace and this will be

02:46.340 --> 02:46.930
empty.

02:47.040 --> 02:52.190
And then I can I can have something else run running here and have two things or three things that I

02:52.190 --> 02:54.650
can have as many workspaces as I want.

02:54.820 --> 03:01.620
And it's just easier for you to be switching between them and we'll be using them when we're doing our

03:01.620 --> 03:03.420
penetration testing attacks.

03:03.420 --> 03:07.590
Now in here you can have your keyboard if you have more than a keyboard that you want to switch between

03:07.590 --> 03:08.320
them.

03:08.400 --> 03:14.940
You have your networks from here so you can access your wireless your wired networks and your wireless.

03:14.940 --> 03:22.110
Now one thing to note you will not be able to access your internal wireless card through a virtual machine.

03:22.410 --> 03:29.040
So the internal wireless card that you have which is connected to your main machine you will not be

03:29.040 --> 03:31.960
able to access it through your virtual machine.

03:31.980 --> 03:38.700
As you remember we said the settings of this computer to be to be connected through not which means

03:38.700 --> 03:43.190
that it has internet connection but the internet connection is coming from the host machine.

03:43.200 --> 03:51.180
So it actually has a virtual into a virtual network set up between this device and my main device which

03:51.180 --> 03:56.640
is this device so there is a connection between the two devices.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.190
This device has intimate access because of the Internet access provided by the main machine

04:06.140 --> 04:12.840
and you can also change your volume from here from the same menu and you can turn off the computer lock

04:12.840 --> 04:15.730
it or enter the preferences from here.

04:16.870 --> 04:22.180
These are just normal preferences you can get yourself familiar with them background's notifications

04:22.570 --> 04:24.170
displays will play with this.

04:24.190 --> 04:29.570
After we fixed the resolution mouse networks all that kind of stuff.

04:30.020 --> 04:35.960
And then you have your battery settings and that's it really for the status bar.

04:35.970 --> 04:40.590
So very simple applications and places the most things I will be using.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.830
And then you can access your network settings from here.

04:43.830 --> 04:48.420
If you had a wireless card connected you'll be able to see the available networks here.

04:49.960 --> 04:55.300
If you want to connect a wireless card all you have to do is connected so I have a Y A U.S. B wireless

04:55.300 --> 04:58.780
card I'm going to connect it now and I'll show you how it shows up.

05:00.220 --> 05:05.720
So you need to go to this menu right here devices and then go to us.

05:05.830 --> 05:13.000
Now this this procedure is the same regardless of the device that you connect it to us be device whether

05:13.000 --> 05:18.280
it's a wireless device or if it's just a memory stick or any US device.

05:18.370 --> 05:23.490
You go to devices us B and then select the device that you want to connect.

05:23.620 --> 05:28.760
So I connected a wireless card and the chipset that's used in the card is called Atheros.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.640
So this is my wireless card.

05:30.760 --> 05:37.930
I'm going to click it and that should connect it now to my virtual machine to the Callimachi.

05:38.320 --> 05:47.980
So if you go here and gone wireless and then select the network and as you can see I can see the networks

05:48.310 --> 05:55.090
that exist around me I can select any network that I want to connect to and just put the password and

05:55.090 --> 05:59.460
connect to the network normally the way you connect to any other network that you want.

06:00.470 --> 06:02.880
OK so I'm going to disconnect my wireless card now.

06:08.090 --> 06:13.760
Now as you can see now the I don't have wireless get connected.

06:16.970 --> 06:23.240
What I'd like to note though I still have internet connection because as I said my main machine right

06:23.240 --> 06:30.500
here the know the Mac OS X machine is connected to my network and this virtual machine is connected

06:30.710 --> 06:35.410
to my Mac machine via internal virtual network.

06:35.810 --> 06:43.350
So the browser that comes in with Kalya the next is this one I'm going to just go to Google to show

06:43.350 --> 06:44.750
you that we have Internet connection

06:47.890 --> 06:50.460
as you can see that we have Internet connection right here.

06:50.460 --> 06:57.520
Now this is just a normal browser you can use it the same way you use any other browser the applications

06:57.520 --> 07:01.720
right here are going to talk about them at the moment because we're going to use them in the future

07:02.020 --> 07:04.420
and you'll see what each one of them does.

07:04.450 --> 07:05.280
Once we get to.
