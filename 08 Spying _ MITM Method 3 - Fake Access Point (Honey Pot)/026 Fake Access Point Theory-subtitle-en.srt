1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:07,310
And this lecture we're going to learn another method in becoming the man in the middle.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:13,280
Now in the previous lectures we saw how we can use the bad US attack to force the traffic through our

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,030
device.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:20,970
One we physically connected to any device that allows us to read all packets modify them and do whatever

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,980
we want with them because essentially all the traffic that is sent or received to the target device

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,050
will be going through our device.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,020
And we also learned how to do IRP poisoning which allowed us to become the man in the middle as well

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,260
and we were able to do the same attacks so we can run with the bad USV attack because again the packets

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,030
will be flowing through our device.

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,830
Today we're going to learn another way of becoming the man in the middle.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,600
This is actually really simple we're going to create an access point.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,200
So it's the same way that sometimes you use your phone to to share your 3G connection.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,150
A lot of the phones now they come in actually built with a feature that allows you to create an access

14
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,730
point and share the connection that you have on your 3G through Wi-Fi so you can connect your phone

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,700
from another phone or from a laptop.

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,950
Now when you actually do this your phone is the server and your phone is the router for example which

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,950
means that all the packets that's sent from any device connected to your IP will be sent to your phone

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,530
cause your phone will actually go and get that request and give it back to the client.

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,770
So you actually don't need to do anything to become the man in the middle.

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,080
You're already the man in the middle when you create an access point on your phone.

21
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,650
So the simplest way to do this is literally just use the feature that comes with your phone.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,200
Create a hotspot and then you can use any of the methods that we did with WSP attacks so you can start

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,950
the shark and start sniffing.

24
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,580
Or you can start doing DNS spoofing.

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,460
You can do this also if you can do all the attacks.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,470
You can even do the scenarios that we talked about and we will talk about that apply to you when you

27
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,450
are the man in the middle.

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,960
The only thing is that just make sure you actually use your wireless card when you start sniffing or

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,520
when you want to do DNS spoof.

30
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,630
So make sure you actually choose lines you're also is your wireless card.

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,680
I'll show you how you can see that.

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,290
You can see that from your menu.

33
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,440
So here if I go on my column and you you can see that my wireless card here.

34
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,660
It's called 9:0.

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,050
So that's the one that you'd want to use when you're sniffing.

36
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:45,820
I'll show you another way of checking your wireless card so if you go on terminal you Quraan Erewhon

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,570
Enghien and it's a list your cards

38
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,250
and as you can see here my 9:0 is my wireless card.

39
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:04,150
So that's the one you'd be using when you're sniffing So using your hotspot so create an hotspots form

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,660
settings and sniffing it.

41
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,100
Use an DNS spoof and they are peaceful.

42
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,580
Sorry using DNS spoof and SSL strip and T-Sharon like we did with WSP.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,190
You can't do that or you can use Zanti right here and from Zanti if you click on the Zanti menu and

44
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,350
you go on these other.

45
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:33,480
Now this will show you a menu that is actually very similar to the man in the middle menu that we saw.

46
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,450
So this man is actually very simple.

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:43,670
The only difference is that when you click on the on it's going to create an access point and you can

48
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,080
enable SSL strip.

49
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,620
You can do DNS spoofing.

50
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,270
You can replace images capture downloads replace downloads.

51
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,700
We explained all these with the people reasoning future of Zanti so I'm not going to explain them again

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,490
because it is very similar.

53
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,490
It's literally the same.

54
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:07,780
So you go on the settings and then you can enable it by tapping on the on or off.

55
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,120
You can also see the log requests by clicking on The View and we see how we can use that as well.

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,330
The logged images and all that.

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,330
We had a look on it with the man in the middle.

58
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:23,470
The only problem with Zanti is that an NDA allows you to share your 3G connection.

59
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,510
So I fear if you're using a tablet that doesn't have 3G like mine or if you just don't have 3G connection

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,380
you will not be able to use Zanti because you basically tethers your 3G connection to your wife.

61
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,280
Exactly like what happens when you go through settings and you create a hotspot.

62
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,620
Now what I'm going to be showing you in future videos is if you use a tool called Man or tool kit my

63
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,940
whole kit is very cool because it allows you to use two wireless cards if you want.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,960
So you can use 3G.

65
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,360
But I'm actually going to be using it with two wireless cards for the reason that if you have a 3G you

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,950
can use Zanti and it's much easier and much simpler.

67
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,750
But if you have two wireless cards and you want to use Mahna then we'll see how well you can use that

68
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,600
and you can basically create fake access point or a hotspot which people can connect to.

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,710
They'll have internet access and whenever they log in to any web so you'll be able to get their log

70
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,820
is the usernames and passwords should be able to do DNS spoofing and all that cool stuff because you're

71
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,050
the man in the middle.

72
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,840
So again I've said that in previous videos when I say you're the man in the middle you can replace the

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,310
attacks you can mix the attacks if you have an idea of a different attack.

74
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,360
You can do it as long as the packets are flowing through your device.

75
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,130
The method is not important.

76
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,150
So as long as you are the man in the middle all these attacks that I'm going to explain and this section

77
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,460
you can apply them to ARPU poisoning for example or you can apply them to the body USP attack.

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,130
So the method of becoming the man in the middle is not important as long as you are the man in the middle.

79
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,750
You can run these attacks.
