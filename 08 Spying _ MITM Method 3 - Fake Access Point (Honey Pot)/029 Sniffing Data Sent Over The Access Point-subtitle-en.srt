1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,840
OK so here I'm on my Windows machine.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:12,250
I'm going to look for my network see if it exists connect to it check if it has internet connection

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:19,240
and then we'll see how we can run all the attacks that we learned before in order to sniff packets modify

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,750
them read them do all that cool stuff.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,500
So as you can see here is my network.

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,210
It's called the Internet and I'm going to click on connect to connect to the network

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,610
and as you can see I was able to successfully connect to the network.

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,220
So let's check if we actually have internet connection.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,010
I'm just going to do a ping on Google com

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,230
and as you can see we're getting responses from Google which means that the network is fully connected

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,420
to the Internet.

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:13,750
OK so I'm just going to open my browser and go on being dot.com and as you can see that I have Internet

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,720
connection here.

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,020
Now we are the man in the middle as I said in the previous video so we can do all the attacks the same

15
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,710
way that we did them with about us be attacked so you can use the shark you can use as a cell strap

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,140
you can use DNS if you can do the scenarios that we did with DARPA poisoning and with the body to we

17
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,000
so as long as you are the man in the middle.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,840
You can do the exact same attacks that we did when you are the one in the middle.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,340
You can mix and match these attacks.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,260
It doesn't matter as long as the packets flow through your device.

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,220
So I'm going to sniff packets just to show you which interface to use and how they can figure out which

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,980
configuration you should use.

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,230
So I'm just going to open up a new terminal window

24
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,280
and I'm going to use T-shirts like we used before.

25
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:20,720
This time I'm going to set the interface to one so sorry you need to space here so remember with the

26
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,530
bad us we attack we say to our.

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,770
And the zero because that was the interface where the packets were coming or flowing through.

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,360
Now we're going to use land one for the reason that Leinwand is the interface that is broadcast in the

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,930
signal.

30
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,920
So it's the same interface that we have it in the configuration here in the manual configuration.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,930
So I have one here to broadcast the signal and I have it in the simple as well as the PH y interface.

32
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,640
So that's the one that you want to sniff on.

33
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,000
Not the one that has the internet connection so none is the one that has internet connection.

34
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,900
I'm going to sniff on line one which is the one that is broadcasting the signal and then we're just

35
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,790
going to put everything else the same.

36
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,130
So I just wanted to show you are.

37
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,320
And that you know that the interface that you should use one is anything when doing all these attacks

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,000
is 9:1 which is the one that you are using to broadcast the signal.

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,640
So let's call this evil a pee cup

40
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,030
going to enter

41
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,600
and now it's capture in packets on one.

42
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,340
And let's just go ahead now again I said you can use the cells as the cell strip and all that.

43
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,960
But we've already explained how to use that and it'll be a waste of time to do it again.

44
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,360
It's the exact same way that you use it when the body has be attacked with the difference that you change

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,150
the interface to the interface that is broadcast and the signal.

46
00:03:51,410 --> 00:04:01,990
So I'm just going to go on my free sites my generator and plug in with my username and password just

47
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,050
to show you that this actually works and all the packets are flowing.

48
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,760
You can actually see here that the number of packets increase straight away when I'm browsing the internet.

49
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:24,760
So we're going to go test evil AP come up with user 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 password then.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,510
Now it's wrong what it should should have been logged in here.

51
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,190
So I'm going to control and see this and then open it and wireshark the same way that we did before

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,450
with our bad US attack.

53
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,860
OK so I downloaded or I shared my tap file here with my device and I'm going to open it using wireshark

54
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,060
like we did before.

55
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,490
So I'm going to go and file open my downloads and I have it here.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:03,160
Evil A kept us up and opened that and I'm going to certain info and firster hasty TV exactly like we

57
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,020
did with the U.S. we attack and I'm going to look for upholster costs.

58
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
And we can see that we have the post request.

59
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,350
Here we go on the line.

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,100
And as you can see I'm going to double click it actually to show it to you better as you can see that

61
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,680
I have my user name is just as evil IP dot com and the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

62
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,440
So exactly this is this is exactly what we did with the bad USP.

63
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,550
It's just to show you that you need to use LAN one or the interface that is broadcast in as the one

64
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,830
that you want to sniff on.

65
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,120
Then you can do all the attacks that we did before you can do the scenarios you can do as a striptease

66
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,450
shark DNS spoof still cookies anything that we did before and use the tools that you can use when you

67
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,680
are the man in the middle.

68
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,530
You can use them because when you do when you create an evil access point you will be the man in the

69
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:04,430
middle naturally so the users or the clients will send will interact with you as the router because

70
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,110
you are there either so they will send you all the requests they want and you will be sending them all

71
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,790
the responses that they should get.
