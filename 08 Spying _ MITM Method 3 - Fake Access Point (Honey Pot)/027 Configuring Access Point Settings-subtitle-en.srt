1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:02,960
Right.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:09,860
So from the previous video we know that if we want to share the 3G connection on our phone or on our

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,180
tablet we can simply just create a hotspot using the default settings all that comes in with Android

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,920
and then we can sniff data or read them modify them the same way that we did with the bad we attack

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:30,170
so we can use T-Sharon we can use DNS spoof we can use SSL strip all that kind of stuff we can do the

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,670
scenarios that we did straight after we create that hotspot so people are going to connect to the hotspot.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,700
Yeah you'll be automatically be the man in the middle because people connected to your own hotspot and

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,030
they will send their requests to your computer because you are the server or to your device and you

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,930
will be sending them the replies.

10
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,250
You could also do the same thing.

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,180
Share your 3G connection and create a hotspot using your wife ID card using Zanti.

12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,460
The nice thing about Zanti it has a graphical interface so you can enable a small strip reading passwords

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,300
usernames.

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,820
Basically do the same stuff that you can do manually but much easier using the graphical user interface.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,980
Again using it using the other.

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,280
And then the interface is very similar to the interface that we used when we were doing HRP poisoning

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,290
with Zanti.

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,680
That's why I didn't go over it because it's very simple.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,870
What I want to go over though is doing the same thing but using a different tool which is called Nat

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,480
tool kit.

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,330
Now I know it exists on laptops and on Android devices so you can use it on both.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,700
It works on Linux operating systems and it's used the exact same way both on Android and on your Linux

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,630
system so if you learn how to use it with Android you'll be able to use it on your laptop.

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,060
My tool kit will allow you to create an access point and evil access point.

25
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,840
The cool thing about it is that we will be able to use two wireless cards instead of using the Internet

26
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,820
on 3G.

27
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,170
So we're going to use the Internet connection on one wireless card and we're going to use the second

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:16,510
wireless card as to broadcast the signal of the router so we will not need 3G for this attack.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:24,800
Now I'm going to use as I said two wireless cards one of them is the internal one and the second one

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,170
will be an external wireless card the external one I'll be connect in it using an RTG cable and RTG

31
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,580
cable is basically just a cable that allows you to connect you SB devices to your Android device.

32
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,870
I'll show you what it looks like.

33
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,830
It's very cheap you can get it for around seven to 10 years.

34
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,070
So around $12.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,830
So just what it looks like so that's what it looks like.

36
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,690
This is a the RTG cable which allows you to charge your phone while connecting it to a wireless card.

37
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,180
Some phones you actually have to use a Y UTG cable because the battery on the device does not support

38
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,310
or it's not enough to run your external wireless device.

39
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,350
So I'm actually using a white cable

40
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,560
so my that comes in with three scripts that allow you to run an evil access point.

41
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:30,160
The first one is the simplest one which is a start no upstream will basically give you an access point

42
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,750
with no internet connection.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,680
So once you run this attack you'll see an access point.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,850
People can connect to it but it will not have an internet connection.

45
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:45,220
And instead it's going to run your web server that you have a local web server that you have on your

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,880
device and you can do DNS spoofing or you can do other stuff to get users to enter usernames or passwords

47
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,560
but there will be no Internet connection on that network.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,960
These are not simple is my favorite one which basically starts a wireless access point with internet

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,460
connection.

50
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,720
So when clients connect to that wireless network they will have internet connection and because you

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,850
are the server all the packets will be coming to you and going back naturally without having to do anything

52
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,970
because they will send it to you voluntarily.

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,970
So once you do that you can do SSL strip you can start the sheriff you can do DNS spoof you can do these

54
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,920
scenarios because you will be the man in the middle.

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,350
The third one which is start now its fall will start your access point with internet connection.

56
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:40,590
It will also start a few tools like SSL strip SSL split fire fireline which sniffs cookies and it will

57
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,350
also attempt to bypass haziest Yes.

58
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,090
Now personally I prefer running.

59
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:52,110
The simple one and then run in any attacks that I want manually because if any of these attacks does

60
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,830
not work properly I can see what's going wrong and I can fix it.

61
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,530
You can also run man I took it from the Kalli menu.

62
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,540
I don't like to do that though because again when you run it from the calumny there is only a start

63
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,900
button.

64
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,600
So you don't really know if it's actually running or if you have something went wrong whereas when you

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,390
run it from the terminal you can see all of the logs all the messages.

66
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,690
And you can see if something went wrong you can see what it is you can debug it and fix it.

67
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,370
So in the next videos we'll see how we can run our evil access point connect to it check if it has internet

68
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,490
connection and see how we can sniff data and modify it or do all the cool stuff that we do when we are

69
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,500
the man in the middle.
