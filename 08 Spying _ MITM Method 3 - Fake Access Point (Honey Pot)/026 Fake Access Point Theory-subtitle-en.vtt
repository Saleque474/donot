00:02.030 --> 00:07.310
And this lecture we're going to learn another method in becoming the man in the middle.

00:07.310 --> 00:13.280
Now in the previous lectures we saw how we can use the bad US attack to force the traffic through our

00:13.280 --> 00:14.030
device.

00:14.060 --> 00:20.970
One we physically connected to any device that allows us to read all packets modify them and do whatever

00:21.140 --> 00:27.980
we want with them because essentially all the traffic that is sent or received to the target device

00:27.980 --> 00:31.050
will be going through our device.

00:31.260 --> 00:36.020
And we also learned how to do IRP poisoning which allowed us to become the man in the middle as well

00:36.320 --> 00:42.260
and we were able to do the same attacks so we can run with the bad USV attack because again the packets

00:42.260 --> 00:44.030
will be flowing through our device.

00:45.580 --> 00:49.830
Today we're going to learn another way of becoming the man in the middle.

00:49.840 --> 00:54.600
This is actually really simple we're going to create an access point.

00:54.680 --> 01:00.200
So it's the same way that sometimes you use your phone to to share your 3G connection.

01:00.200 --> 01:05.150
A lot of the phones now they come in actually built with a feature that allows you to create an access

01:05.150 --> 01:10.730
point and share the connection that you have on your 3G through Wi-Fi so you can connect your phone

01:10.730 --> 01:13.700
from another phone or from a laptop.

01:13.710 --> 01:19.950
Now when you actually do this your phone is the server and your phone is the router for example which

01:19.950 --> 01:25.950
means that all the packets that's sent from any device connected to your IP will be sent to your phone

01:25.950 --> 01:30.530
cause your phone will actually go and get that request and give it back to the client.

01:31.610 --> 01:34.770
So you actually don't need to do anything to become the man in the middle.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.080
You're already the man in the middle when you create an access point on your phone.

01:39.110 --> 01:43.650
So the simplest way to do this is literally just use the feature that comes with your phone.

01:43.760 --> 01:51.200
Create a hotspot and then you can use any of the methods that we did with WSP attacks so you can start

01:51.200 --> 01:52.950
the shark and start sniffing.

01:53.060 --> 01:55.580
Or you can start doing DNS spoofing.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.460
You can do this also if you can do all the attacks.

01:58.470 --> 02:03.470
You can even do the scenarios that we talked about and we will talk about that apply to you when you

02:03.470 --> 02:06.450
are the man in the middle.

02:06.500 --> 02:11.960
The only thing is that just make sure you actually use your wireless card when you start sniffing or

02:11.960 --> 02:13.520
when you want to do DNS spoof.

02:13.670 --> 02:17.630
So make sure you actually choose lines you're also is your wireless card.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.680
I'll show you how you can see that.

02:19.820 --> 02:22.290
You can see that from your menu.

02:22.370 --> 02:28.440
So here if I go on my column and you you can see that my wireless card here.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.660
It's called 9:0.

02:30.700 --> 02:35.050
So that's the one that you'd want to use when you're sniffing.

02:35.210 --> 02:45.820
I'll show you another way of checking your wireless card so if you go on terminal you Quraan Erewhon

02:45.840 --> 02:47.570
Enghien and it's a list your cards

02:52.010 --> 02:55.250
and as you can see here my 9:0 is my wireless card.

02:55.290 --> 03:04.150
So that's the one you'd be using when you're sniffing So using your hotspot so create an hotspots form

03:04.150 --> 03:05.660
settings and sniffing it.

03:05.820 --> 03:09.100
Use an DNS spoof and they are peaceful.

03:09.130 --> 03:13.580
Sorry using DNS spoof and SSL strip and T-Sharon like we did with WSP.

03:13.680 --> 03:22.190
You can't do that or you can use Zanti right here and from Zanti if you click on the Zanti menu and

03:22.190 --> 03:26.350
you go on these other.

03:26.370 --> 03:33.480
Now this will show you a menu that is actually very similar to the man in the middle menu that we saw.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.450
So this man is actually very simple.

03:36.450 --> 03:43.670
The only difference is that when you click on the on it's going to create an access point and you can

03:43.670 --> 03:45.080
enable SSL strip.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.620
You can do DNS spoofing.

03:47.630 --> 03:52.270
You can replace images capture downloads replace downloads.

03:52.340 --> 03:58.700
We explained all these with the people reasoning future of Zanti so I'm not going to explain them again

03:59.000 --> 04:00.490
because it is very similar.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.490
It's literally the same.

04:01.490 --> 04:07.780
So you go on the settings and then you can enable it by tapping on the on or off.

04:08.010 --> 04:13.120
You can also see the log requests by clicking on The View and we see how we can use that as well.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.330
The logged images and all that.

04:14.330 --> 04:17.330
We had a look on it with the man in the middle.

04:17.330 --> 04:23.470
The only problem with Zanti is that an NDA allows you to share your 3G connection.

04:23.690 --> 04:29.510
So I fear if you're using a tablet that doesn't have 3G like mine or if you just don't have 3G connection

04:30.080 --> 04:36.380
you will not be able to use Zanti because you basically tethers your 3G connection to your wife.

04:36.380 --> 04:41.280
Exactly like what happens when you go through settings and you create a hotspot.

04:41.810 --> 04:48.620
Now what I'm going to be showing you in future videos is if you use a tool called Man or tool kit my

04:48.770 --> 04:52.940
whole kit is very cool because it allows you to use two wireless cards if you want.

04:52.940 --> 04:53.960
So you can use 3G.

04:53.990 --> 04:59.360
But I'm actually going to be using it with two wireless cards for the reason that if you have a 3G you

04:59.360 --> 05:01.950
can use Zanti and it's much easier and much simpler.

05:03.610 --> 05:07.750
But if you have two wireless cards and you want to use Mahna then we'll see how well you can use that

05:08.080 --> 05:13.600
and you can basically create fake access point or a hotspot which people can connect to.

05:13.600 --> 05:19.710
They'll have internet access and whenever they log in to any web so you'll be able to get their log

05:19.710 --> 05:24.820
is the usernames and passwords should be able to do DNS spoofing and all that cool stuff because you're

05:24.820 --> 05:26.050
the man in the middle.

05:26.050 --> 05:31.840
So again I've said that in previous videos when I say you're the man in the middle you can replace the

05:31.840 --> 05:35.310
attacks you can mix the attacks if you have an idea of a different attack.

05:35.320 --> 05:39.360
You can do it as long as the packets are flowing through your device.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.130
The method is not important.

05:41.290 --> 05:46.150
So as long as you are the man in the middle all these attacks that I'm going to explain and this section

05:46.150 --> 05:51.460
you can apply them to ARPU poisoning for example or you can apply them to the body USP attack.

05:51.640 --> 05:57.130
So the method of becoming the man in the middle is not important as long as you are the man in the middle.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.750
You can run these attacks.
