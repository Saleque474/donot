1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,050
OK.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,280
So before I actually start using mine i kids I'd like to show you the wireless interfaces that I have

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,170
installed on my device.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,680
So right now I only have my internal device or my internal wireless card.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,460
And as you can see it's connected to a network called to you to I'm going to launch the terminal and

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,510
just confirm that for you.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,020
So the command that you use to see your wireless cards is either config

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:41,180
and as you can see that I have land zero wireless card here that's my internal one and it's associated

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,410
with a network called TV2 So yes ID is the name of the network and it's too wide too.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:55,380
So this will be used as the card that will provide the internet connection and I'll use my external

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,380
wireless card to broadcast the signal of the network.

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,120
So the external wireless card is a U.S. card and I'm going to connect and use an RTG cable that I showed

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,980
you on it looks like in the previous video.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:21,230
So I'm going to connect my external cowd physically and then I'm going to give it two seconds and I'm

15
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,000
going to run I w config to see if the card has been recognized.

16
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm going to and as you can see now we have a card called 9 1 and it's not connected to any network

17
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,560
right now.

18
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,840
So this is perfect.

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,290
Now I'm going to go back to my launcher menu and show you the settings that you can do for the mana

20
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,670
to.

21
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:57,610
So the first option is the interface and I could hear LAN because this is the external the name of the

22
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,110
external wireless card.

23
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,120
And this is what we are going to use to broadcast the signal.

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,830
The VSS idea here this is the MAC address of the network.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,590
You can put any mac address that you want.

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,920
The SS ID is the name of the network that will be broadcasted.

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,790
So I'm calling for the Internet to attract people to connect to that network.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,460
And then when they connect I'll naturally be the man in the middle and I can do any man in the middle

29
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,540
that I like to use in T-shirt.

30
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:33,880
As a sales rep do any of the scenarios that we did DNS pooping whatever that I want the channel is the

31
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,320
channel that is going to be used to broadcast the signal.

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,200
And these last two options are for karma.

33
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,830
Karma is an option that allows you to make a network or an access point that is identical to an existing

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,150
access point.

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,860
The reason why you do this is you can create an access point identical to an access point that uses

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,750
an encryption or a key and then trigger the users to connect to your fake access point and then ask

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,780
them to enter the user name who's in a web page so the users have to be socially engineered and you

38
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,010
have to kind of convince them to enter their username and password in a web site for their Wi-Fi network.

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,710
And then you'll have the username and password for the wife and that's all.

40
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,970
Now we're not going to be doing this in this video because we're all we want to do is just create an

41
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,580
access point with internet connection get people to connect to it.

42
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,190
And then we will get them on in the middle so we can do any of them on in the middle attacks that we

43
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,350
know so I'm going to leave these to us zero.

44
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,820
And the other thing that I want to show you here in the settings.

45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,270
I'm going to go to the not mine simple which is the one that we're going to use.

46
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,590
So it's access point with internet connection only and it's not going to do any of the man in the middle

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,800
attacks we're going to have to do them manually.

48
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,820
The most important thing is just make sure that you have your upstream as the wireless card that is

49
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,930
connected to the Internet.

50
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,230
So I showed you before how landgrab was associated with the network called y2.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:13,190
So this is my interface that is connected to the Internet in the upstream and then in the future I have

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,080
a line one which is my interface that will be used to broadcast the signal.

53
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,260
I've also removed all the comments here.

54
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,220
You usually see hash tags before all of these commands because when you remove them then you'll be able

55
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,110
to turn off the wireless network by type in return.

56
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,400
So that's it.

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,660
Now I just want to show you the things that I had.

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,330
The first thing that I'm going to do before I start my access point is make sure that my IP tables is

59
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,760
clear and it does not contain any rules that might draw packets and prevent the access point from working

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,770
properly.

61
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,570
So we did this when we did divide us we attack as well to allow the packets to flow freely through our

62
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,530
device and we use the scripts that I had in my resources which is called flush IP tables.

63
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,210
So I'm just going to use the exact same script right now.

64
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,430
So it's Bysshe I have it started.

65
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:21,170
And as the card piles flush IP tables.

66
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:28,880
SH And because you don't see any error messages that means the command was run successfully.

67
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,730
So the next thing we're going to do is run our evil access point.

68
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:41,870
So first I'm going to navigate to we're not Mahna is installed which is in us or share

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,430
Mannat toolkit

70
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,450
and we're on mana.

71
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,700
So I'm basically just using CD to navigate or to change the working directory to that working directory

72
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,100
where the run scripts for Mom Mannah are stored.

73
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,110
And I'm just going to do an ls to show you all the transcripts that you can use.

74
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,940
So Elyse will just list the files that are in that directory.

75
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,530
And as you can see that we have a file for each option that I explained in the previous video.

76
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,620
So file for the fall for the simple and for the no upstream and each one of them has a kit kat and a

77
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,820
lollipop version.

78
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:31,180
So the Kit-Kat is for Android for point four point four and a lollipop is for Android 5 and you can

79
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:39,240
also see that we have the option that I didn't explain it's to run back to our factory on the access

80
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,660
point.

81
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,530
We will run.

82
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,860
Now I'm not going to use that right now and I'm going to explain this in future videos.

83
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,080
So for now we're just going to ignore it.

84
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,670
Now I'm only going to run the simple nuts which will create a network that has internet connection people

85
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,800
can connect to it access the Internet and then I can do all the attacks manually like we did before

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,020
so we can do DNS spoofing SSL of all that.

87
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,090
As I said before the same way that we did them with the bad U.S. attack.

88
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:17,890
So I'm going on the bash start mana or sorry start not simple

89
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,370
Kit-Kat because I have androids point four point four.

90
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:33,170
SH I'm going to return and I'm going to give it some time to start the access point.

91
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,350
Now the access point is running.

92
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,760
And as you can see it says hit enter to kill me or to stop the access point.

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,330
OK so everything is done now.

94
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,760
The attack is running and the network should be broadcasting.

95
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,830
So now you have an Internet network and it's sharing the wireless connection is sharing the internet

96
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,260
connection on one of my wireless cards which is called Gannes you know and it's broadcast in it through

97
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,930
another wireless card connected using the RTG cable which is called Leinwand and when people connect

98
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,730
to this network they will have internet connection and we will naturally be the one in the middle because

99
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,260
we are the servers so they have to send the packets to us and we will be sending the responses.

100
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,090
Therefore we carry these packets modify them and do all the attacks that we learned and we will learn

101
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,930
when you are the man in the middle.

102
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,970
So lets just check and see if the network if we can see the network.

103
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,580
And as you can see here we have a network called the internet.

104
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,770
I'm not going to connect to it now because that will disconnect while you're mirroring here for the

105
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,610
Android device.

106
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,850
So I'm going to connect to it from a Windows device in the next video and we'll see what we can do.

107
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,320
And we'll check if it has internet connection or not.
