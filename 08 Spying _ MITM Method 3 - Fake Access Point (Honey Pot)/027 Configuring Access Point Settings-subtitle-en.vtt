WEBVTT

00:02.620 --> 00:02.960
Right.

00:02.950 --> 00:09.860
So from the previous video we know that if we want to share the 3G connection on our phone or on our

00:09.860 --> 00:17.180
tablet we can simply just create a hotspot using the default settings all that comes in with Android

00:17.690 --> 00:23.920
and then we can sniff data or read them modify them the same way that we did with the bad we attack

00:23.930 --> 00:30.170
so we can use T-Sharon we can use DNS spoof we can use SSL strip all that kind of stuff we can do the

00:30.170 --> 00:35.670
scenarios that we did straight after we create that hotspot so people are going to connect to the hotspot.

00:35.720 --> 00:40.700
Yeah you'll be automatically be the man in the middle because people connected to your own hotspot and

00:40.700 --> 00:47.030
they will send their requests to your computer because you are the server or to your device and you

00:47.030 --> 00:48.930
will be sending them the replies.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.250
You could also do the same thing.

00:52.370 --> 00:58.180
Share your 3G connection and create a hotspot using your wife ID card using Zanti.

00:58.190 --> 01:04.460
The nice thing about Zanti it has a graphical interface so you can enable a small strip reading passwords

01:04.460 --> 01:05.300
usernames.

01:05.300 --> 01:10.820
Basically do the same stuff that you can do manually but much easier using the graphical user interface.

01:10.850 --> 01:12.980
Again using it using the other.

01:13.120 --> 01:19.280
And then the interface is very similar to the interface that we used when we were doing HRP poisoning

01:19.280 --> 01:20.290
with Zanti.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.680
That's why I didn't go over it because it's very simple.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.870
What I want to go over though is doing the same thing but using a different tool which is called Nat

01:28.890 --> 01:30.480
tool kit.

01:30.690 --> 01:37.330
Now I know it exists on laptops and on Android devices so you can use it on both.

01:37.350 --> 01:44.700
It works on Linux operating systems and it's used the exact same way both on Android and on your Linux

01:44.700 --> 01:49.630
system so if you learn how to use it with Android you'll be able to use it on your laptop.

01:51.860 --> 01:57.060
My tool kit will allow you to create an access point and evil access point.

01:57.110 --> 02:02.840
The cool thing about it is that we will be able to use two wireless cards instead of using the Internet

02:02.870 --> 02:03.820
on 3G.

02:04.010 --> 02:09.170
So we're going to use the Internet connection on one wireless card and we're going to use the second

02:09.170 --> 02:16.510
wireless card as to broadcast the signal of the router so we will not need 3G for this attack.

02:16.520 --> 02:24.800
Now I'm going to use as I said two wireless cards one of them is the internal one and the second one

02:24.800 --> 02:32.170
will be an external wireless card the external one I'll be connect in it using an RTG cable and RTG

02:32.170 --> 02:39.580
cable is basically just a cable that allows you to connect you SB devices to your Android device.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.870
I'll show you what it looks like.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.830
It's very cheap you can get it for around seven to 10 years.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.070
So around $12.

02:47.440 --> 02:53.830
So just what it looks like so that's what it looks like.

02:53.890 --> 03:00.690
This is a the RTG cable which allows you to charge your phone while connecting it to a wireless card.

03:01.030 --> 03:07.180
Some phones you actually have to use a Y UTG cable because the battery on the device does not support

03:07.330 --> 03:12.310
or it's not enough to run your external wireless device.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.350
So I'm actually using a white cable

03:18.650 --> 03:23.560
so my that comes in with three scripts that allow you to run an evil access point.

03:23.830 --> 03:30.160
The first one is the simplest one which is a start no upstream will basically give you an access point

03:30.490 --> 03:31.750
with no internet connection.

03:31.750 --> 03:35.680
So once you run this attack you'll see an access point.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.850
People can connect to it but it will not have an internet connection.

03:39.850 --> 03:45.220
And instead it's going to run your web server that you have a local web server that you have on your

03:45.220 --> 03:51.880
device and you can do DNS spoofing or you can do other stuff to get users to enter usernames or passwords

03:51.910 --> 03:54.560
but there will be no Internet connection on that network.

03:57.120 --> 04:03.960
These are not simple is my favorite one which basically starts a wireless access point with internet

04:03.960 --> 04:04.460
connection.

04:04.470 --> 04:09.720
So when clients connect to that wireless network they will have internet connection and because you

04:09.720 --> 04:14.850
are the server all the packets will be coming to you and going back naturally without having to do anything

04:14.850 --> 04:16.970
because they will send it to you voluntarily.

04:17.980 --> 04:23.970
So once you do that you can do SSL strip you can start the sheriff you can do DNS spoof you can do these

04:23.970 --> 04:27.920
scenarios because you will be the man in the middle.

04:27.930 --> 04:33.350
The third one which is start now its fall will start your access point with internet connection.

04:33.350 --> 04:40.590
It will also start a few tools like SSL strip SSL split fire fireline which sniffs cookies and it will

04:40.590 --> 04:43.350
also attempt to bypass haziest Yes.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.090
Now personally I prefer running.

04:45.090 --> 04:52.110
The simple one and then run in any attacks that I want manually because if any of these attacks does

04:52.110 --> 04:55.830
not work properly I can see what's going wrong and I can fix it.

04:58.100 --> 05:03.530
You can also run man I took it from the Kalli menu.

05:03.530 --> 05:08.540
I don't like to do that though because again when you run it from the calumny there is only a start

05:08.540 --> 05:08.900
button.

05:08.900 --> 05:13.600
So you don't really know if it's actually running or if you have something went wrong whereas when you

05:13.600 --> 05:17.390
run it from the terminal you can see all of the logs all the messages.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.690
And you can see if something went wrong you can see what it is you can debug it and fix it.

05:23.130 --> 05:29.370
So in the next videos we'll see how we can run our evil access point connect to it check if it has internet

05:29.370 --> 05:35.490
connection and see how we can sniff data and modify it or do all the cool stuff that we do when we are

05:35.490 --> 05:36.500
the man in the middle.
