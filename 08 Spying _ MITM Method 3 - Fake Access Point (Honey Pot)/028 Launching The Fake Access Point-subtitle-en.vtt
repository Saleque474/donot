00:01.500 --> 00:02.050
OK.

00:02.250 --> 00:08.280
So before I actually start using mine i kids I'd like to show you the wireless interfaces that I have

00:08.280 --> 00:10.170
installed on my device.

00:10.170 --> 00:14.680
So right now I only have my internal device or my internal wireless card.

00:14.730 --> 00:21.460
And as you can see it's connected to a network called to you to I'm going to launch the terminal and

00:21.460 --> 00:25.510
just confirm that for you.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.020
So the command that you use to see your wireless cards is either config

00:33.700 --> 00:41.180
and as you can see that I have land zero wireless card here that's my internal one and it's associated

00:41.180 --> 00:47.410
with a network called TV2 So yes ID is the name of the network and it's too wide too.

00:47.450 --> 00:55.380
So this will be used as the card that will provide the internet connection and I'll use my external

00:55.380 --> 00:59.380
wireless card to broadcast the signal of the network.

00:59.610 --> 01:06.120
So the external wireless card is a U.S. card and I'm going to connect and use an RTG cable that I showed

01:06.120 --> 01:10.980
you on it looks like in the previous video.

01:11.160 --> 01:21.230
So I'm going to connect my external cowd physically and then I'm going to give it two seconds and I'm

01:21.230 --> 01:25.000
going to run I w config to see if the card has been recognized.

01:26.510 --> 01:36.780
I'm going to and as you can see now we have a card called 9 1 and it's not connected to any network

01:36.780 --> 01:37.560
right now.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.840
So this is perfect.

01:40.840 --> 01:47.290
Now I'm going to go back to my launcher menu and show you the settings that you can do for the mana

01:47.590 --> 01:50.670
to.

01:50.730 --> 01:57.610
So the first option is the interface and I could hear LAN because this is the external the name of the

01:57.610 --> 01:59.110
external wireless card.

01:59.170 --> 02:03.120
And this is what we are going to use to broadcast the signal.

02:03.820 --> 02:07.830
The VSS idea here this is the MAC address of the network.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.590
You can put any mac address that you want.

02:11.020 --> 02:14.920
The SS ID is the name of the network that will be broadcasted.

02:14.950 --> 02:18.790
So I'm calling for the Internet to attract people to connect to that network.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.460
And then when they connect I'll naturally be the man in the middle and I can do any man in the middle

02:23.490 --> 02:25.540
that I like to use in T-shirt.

02:25.630 --> 02:33.880
As a sales rep do any of the scenarios that we did DNS pooping whatever that I want the channel is the

02:33.880 --> 02:37.320
channel that is going to be used to broadcast the signal.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.200
And these last two options are for karma.

02:40.480 --> 02:47.830
Karma is an option that allows you to make a network or an access point that is identical to an existing

02:47.920 --> 02:49.150
access point.

02:49.150 --> 02:54.860
The reason why you do this is you can create an access point identical to an access point that uses

02:55.190 --> 03:01.750
an encryption or a key and then trigger the users to connect to your fake access point and then ask

03:01.750 --> 03:07.780
them to enter the user name who's in a web page so the users have to be socially engineered and you

03:07.780 --> 03:14.010
have to kind of convince them to enter their username and password in a web site for their Wi-Fi network.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.710
And then you'll have the username and password for the wife and that's all.

03:16.810 --> 03:21.970
Now we're not going to be doing this in this video because we're all we want to do is just create an

03:21.970 --> 03:25.580
access point with internet connection get people to connect to it.

03:25.690 --> 03:30.190
And then we will get them on in the middle so we can do any of them on in the middle attacks that we

03:30.190 --> 03:35.350
know so I'm going to leave these to us zero.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.820
And the other thing that I want to show you here in the settings.

03:38.820 --> 03:44.270
I'm going to go to the not mine simple which is the one that we're going to use.

03:44.490 --> 03:49.590
So it's access point with internet connection only and it's not going to do any of the man in the middle

03:49.630 --> 03:53.800
attacks we're going to have to do them manually.

03:53.810 --> 03:58.820
The most important thing is just make sure that you have your upstream as the wireless card that is

03:58.820 --> 03:59.930
connected to the Internet.

03:59.930 --> 04:05.230
So I showed you before how landgrab was associated with the network called y2.

04:05.240 --> 04:13.190
So this is my interface that is connected to the Internet in the upstream and then in the future I have

04:13.760 --> 04:20.080
a line one which is my interface that will be used to broadcast the signal.

04:20.090 --> 04:22.260
I've also removed all the comments here.

04:22.450 --> 04:28.220
You usually see hash tags before all of these commands because when you remove them then you'll be able

04:28.220 --> 04:32.110
to turn off the wireless network by type in return.

04:33.270 --> 04:34.400
So that's it.

04:34.400 --> 04:40.660
Now I just want to show you the things that I had.

04:40.800 --> 04:48.330
The first thing that I'm going to do before I start my access point is make sure that my IP tables is

04:48.330 --> 04:53.760
clear and it does not contain any rules that might draw packets and prevent the access point from working

04:53.760 --> 04:54.770
properly.

04:54.780 --> 05:00.570
So we did this when we did divide us we attack as well to allow the packets to flow freely through our

05:00.570 --> 05:07.530
device and we use the scripts that I had in my resources which is called flush IP tables.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.210
So I'm just going to use the exact same script right now.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.430
So it's Bysshe I have it started.

05:13.450 --> 05:21.170
And as the card piles flush IP tables.

05:21.410 --> 05:28.880
SH And because you don't see any error messages that means the command was run successfully.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.730
So the next thing we're going to do is run our evil access point.

05:33.730 --> 05:41.870
So first I'm going to navigate to we're not Mahna is installed which is in us or share

05:44.500 --> 05:45.430
Mannat toolkit

05:48.620 --> 05:52.450
and we're on mana.

05:53.100 --> 05:59.700
So I'm basically just using CD to navigate or to change the working directory to that working directory

05:59.700 --> 06:03.100
where the run scripts for Mom Mannah are stored.

06:03.210 --> 06:07.110
And I'm just going to do an ls to show you all the transcripts that you can use.

06:07.140 --> 06:10.940
So Elyse will just list the files that are in that directory.

06:11.460 --> 06:16.530
And as you can see that we have a file for each option that I explained in the previous video.

06:16.710 --> 06:22.620
So file for the fall for the simple and for the no upstream and each one of them has a kit kat and a

06:22.620 --> 06:23.820
lollipop version.

06:23.880 --> 06:31.180
So the Kit-Kat is for Android for point four point four and a lollipop is for Android 5 and you can

06:31.180 --> 06:39.240
also see that we have the option that I didn't explain it's to run back to our factory on the access

06:39.240 --> 06:39.660
point.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.530
We will run.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.860
Now I'm not going to use that right now and I'm going to explain this in future videos.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.080
So for now we're just going to ignore it.

06:48.180 --> 06:53.670
Now I'm only going to run the simple nuts which will create a network that has internet connection people

06:53.670 --> 06:58.800
can connect to it access the Internet and then I can do all the attacks manually like we did before

06:58.800 --> 07:01.020
so we can do DNS spoofing SSL of all that.

07:01.110 --> 07:07.090
As I said before the same way that we did them with the bad U.S. attack.

07:07.190 --> 07:17.890
So I'm going on the bash start mana or sorry start not simple

07:20.850 --> 07:26.370
Kit-Kat because I have androids point four point four.

07:26.450 --> 07:33.170
SH I'm going to return and I'm going to give it some time to start the access point.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.350
Now the access point is running.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.760
And as you can see it says hit enter to kill me or to stop the access point.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.330
OK so everything is done now.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.760
The attack is running and the network should be broadcasting.

07:47.760 --> 07:53.830
So now you have an Internet network and it's sharing the wireless connection is sharing the internet

07:53.830 --> 07:59.260
connection on one of my wireless cards which is called Gannes you know and it's broadcast in it through

07:59.260 --> 08:05.930
another wireless card connected using the RTG cable which is called Leinwand and when people connect

08:05.930 --> 08:10.730
to this network they will have internet connection and we will naturally be the one in the middle because

08:10.730 --> 08:15.260
we are the servers so they have to send the packets to us and we will be sending the responses.

08:15.260 --> 08:20.090
Therefore we carry these packets modify them and do all the attacks that we learned and we will learn

08:20.390 --> 08:21.930
when you are the man in the middle.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.970
So lets just check and see if the network if we can see the network.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.580
And as you can see here we have a network called the internet.

08:31.670 --> 08:36.770
I'm not going to connect to it now because that will disconnect while you're mirroring here for the

08:36.770 --> 08:37.610
Android device.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.850
So I'm going to connect to it from a Windows device in the next video and we'll see what we can do.

08:42.860 --> 08:45.320
And we'll check if it has internet connection or not.
